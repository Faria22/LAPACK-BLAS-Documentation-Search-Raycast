 CSPTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
 symmetric matrix A stored in packed format using the factorization
 A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by CSPTRF.

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

Ap : Complex Array, Dimension (n*(n+1)/2) [in]
> The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
> obtain the factor U or L as computed by CSPTRF, stored as a
> packed triangular matrix.

Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
> as determined by CSPTRF.

B : Complex Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
> On exit, the solution matrix X.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
