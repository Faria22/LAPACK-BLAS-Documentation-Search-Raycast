 CLARCM performs a very simple matrix-matrix multiplication:
          C := A * B,
 where A is M by M and real; B is M by N and complex;
 C is M by N and complex.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A and of the matrix C.
> M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns and rows of the matrix B and
> the number of columns of the matrix C.
> N >= 0.

A : Real Array, Dimension (lda, M) [in]
> On entry, A contains the M by M matrix A.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >=max(1,M).

B : Complex Array, Dimension (ldb, N) [in]
> On entry, B contains the M by N matrix B.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >=max(1,M).

C : Complex Array, Dimension (ldc, N) [out]
> On exit, C contains the M by N matrix C.

Ldc : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >=max(1,M).

Rwork : Real Array, Dimension (2*m*n) [out]
