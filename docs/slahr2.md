subroutine slahr2 (

```

 SLAHR2 reduces the first NB columns of A real general n-BY-(n-k+1)
 matrix A so that elements below the k-th subdiagonal are zero. The
 reduction is performed by an orthogonal similarity transformation
 Q**T * A * Q. The routine returns the matrices V and T which determine
 Q as a block reflector I - V*T*V**T, and also the matrix Y = A * V * T.

 This is an auxiliary routine called by SGEHRD.

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.

K : Integer [in]
> The offset for the reduction. Elements below the k-th
> subdiagonal in the first NB columns are reduced to zero.
> K < N.

Nb : Integer [in]
> The number of columns to be reduced.

A : Real Array, Dimension (lda,n-k+1) [in,out]
> On entry, the n-by-(n-k+1) general matrix A.
> On exit, the elements on and above the k-th subdiagonal in
> the first NB columns are overwritten with the corresponding
> elements of the reduced matrix; the elements below the k-th
> subdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the matrix Q as a
> product of elementary reflectors. The other columns of A are
> unchanged. See Further Details.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

Tau : Real Array, Dimension (nb) [out]
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors. See Further
> Details.

T : Real Array, Dimension (ldt,nb) [out]
> The upper triangular matrix T.

Ldt : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T.  LDT >= NB.

Y : Real Array, Dimension (ldy,nb) [out]
> The n-by-nb matrix Y.

Ldy : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Y. LDY >= N.
