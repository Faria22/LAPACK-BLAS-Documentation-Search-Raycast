 CGESC2 solves a system of linear equations

           A * X = scale* RHS

 with a general N-by-N matrix A using the LU factorization with
 complete pivoting computed by CGETC2.


## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A.

A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda, N) [in]
> On entry, the  LU part of the factorization of the n-by-n
> matrix A computed by CGETC2:  A = P * L * U * Q

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1, N).

Rhs : Complex Array, Dimension N. [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side vector b.
> On exit, the solution vector X.

Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n). [in]
> The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the
> matrix has been interchanged with row IPIV(i).

Jpiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n). [in]
> The pivot indices; for 1 <= j <= N, column j of the
> matrix has been interchanged with column JPIV(j).

Scale : Real [out]
> On exit, SCALE contains the scale factor. SCALE is chosen
> 0 <= SCALE <= 1 to prevent overflow in the solution.
