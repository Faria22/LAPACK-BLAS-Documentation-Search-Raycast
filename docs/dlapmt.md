```fortran
subroutine dlapmt	(	logical	forwrd,
		integer	m,
		integer	n,
		double precision, dimension(ldx, *)	x,
		integer	ldx,
		integer, dimension(*)	k )
```

 DLAPMT rearranges the columns of the M by N matrix X as specified
 by the permutation K(1),K(2),...,K(N) of the integers 1,...,N.
 If FORWRD = .TRUE.,  forward permutation:

      X(*,K(J)) is moved X(*,J) for J = 1,2,...,N.

 If FORWRD = .FALSE., backward permutation:

      X(*,J) is moved to X(*,K(J)) for J = 1,2,...,N.

## Parameters
Forwrd : Logical [in]
> = .TRUE., forward permutation
> = .FALSE., backward permutation

M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix X. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix X. N >= 0.

X : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldx,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the M by N matrix X.
> On exit, X contains the permuted matrix X.

Ldx : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array X, LDX >= MAX(1,M).

K : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> On entry, K contains the permutation vector. K is used as
> internal workspace, but reset to its original value on
> output.
