 CUNML2 overwrites the general complex m-by-n matrix C with

       Q * C  if SIDE = 'L' and TRANS = 'N', or

       Q**H* C  if SIDE = 'L' and TRANS = 'C', or

       C * Q  if SIDE = 'R' and TRANS = 'N', or

       C * Q**H if SIDE = 'R' and TRANS = 'C',

 where Q is a complex unitary matrix defined as the product of k
 elementary reflectors

       Q = H(k)**H . . . H(2)**H H(1)**H

 as returned by CGELQF. Q is of order m if SIDE = 'L' and of order n
 if SIDE = 'R'.

## Parameters
Side : Character*1 [in]
> = 'L': apply Q or Q**H from the Left
> = 'R': apply Q or Q**H from the Right

Trans : Character*1 [in]
> = 'N': apply Q  (No transpose)
> = 'C': apply Q**H (Conjugate transpose)

M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix C. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix C. N >= 0.

K : Integer [in]
> The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines
> the matrix Q.
> If SIDE = 'L', M >= K >= 0;
> if SIDE = 'R', N >= K >= 0.

A : Complex Array, Dimension [in]
> (LDA,M) if SIDE = 'L',
> (LDA,N) if SIDE = 'R'
> The i-th row must contain the vector which defines the
> elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as returned by
> CGELQF in the first k rows of its array argument A.
> A is modified by the routine but restored on exit.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,K).

Tau : Complex Array, Dimension (k) [in]
> TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
> reflector H(i), as returned by CGELQF.

C : Complex Array, Dimension (ldc,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the m-by-n matrix C.
> On exit, C is overwritten by Q*C or Q**H*C or C*Q**H or C*Q.

Ldc : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M).

Work : Complex Array, Dimension [out]
> (N) if SIDE = 'L',
> (M) if SIDE = 'R'

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
