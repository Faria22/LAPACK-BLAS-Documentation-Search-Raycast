 DSGESV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 DSGESV first attempts to factorize the matrix in SINGLE PRECISION
 and use this factorization within an iterative refinement procedure
 to produce a solution with DOUBLE PRECISION normwise backward error
 quality (see below). If the approach fails the method switches to a
 DOUBLE PRECISION factorization and solve.

 The iterative refinement is not going to be a winning strategy if
 the ratio SINGLE PRECISION performance over DOUBLE PRECISION
 performance is too small. A reasonable strategy should take the
 number of right-hand sides and the size of the matrix into account.
 This might be done with a call to ILAENV in the future. Up to now, we
 always try iterative refinement.

 The iterative refinement process is stopped if
     ITER > ITERMAX
 or for all the RHS we have:
     RNRM < SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX
 where
     o ITER is the number of the current iteration in the iterative
       refinement process
     o RNRM is the infinity-norm of the residual
     o XNRM is the infinity-norm of the solution
     o ANRM is the infinity-operator-norm of the matrix A
     o EPS is the machine epsilon returned by DLAMCH('Epsilon')
 The value ITERMAX and BWDMAX are fixed to 30 and 1.0D+00
 respectively.

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
> matrix A.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

A : Double Precision Array, [in,out]
> dimension (LDA,N)
> On entry, the N-by-N coefficient matrix A.
> On exit, if iterative refinement has been successfully used
> (INFO = 0 and ITER >= 0, see description below), then A is
> unchanged, if double precision factorization has been used
> (INFO = 0 and ITER < 0, see description below), then the
> array A contains the factors L and U from the factorization
> A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [out]
> The pivot indices that define the permutation matrix P;
> row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
> Corresponds either to the single precision factorization
> (if INFO = 0 and ITER >= 0) or the double precision
> factorization (if INFO = 0 and ITER < 0).

B : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in]
> The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

X : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldx,nrhs) [out]
> If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.

Ldx : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

Work : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n,nrhs) [out]
> This array is used to hold the residual vectors.

Swork : Real Array, Dimension (n*(n+nrhs)) [out]
> This array is used to use the single precision matrix and the
> right-hand sides or solutions in single precision.

Iter : Integer [out]
> < 0: iterative refinement has failed, double precision
> factorization has been performed
> -1 : the routine fell back to full precision for
> implementation- or machine-specific reasons
> -2 : narrowing the precision induced an overflow,
> the routine fell back to full precision
> -3 : failure of SGETRF
> -31: stop the iterative refinement after the 30th
> iterations
> > 0: iterative refinement has been successfully used.
> Returns the number of iterations

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) computed in DOUBLE PRECISION is
> exactly zero.  The factorization has been completed,
> but the factor U is exactly singular, so the solution
> could not be computed.
