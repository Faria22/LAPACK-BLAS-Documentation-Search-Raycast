# ZTREXC

## Function Signature

```fortran
ZTREXC(COMPQ, N, T, LDT, Q, LDQ, IFST, ILST, INFO)
```

## Description


 ZTREXC reorders the Schur factorization of a complex matrix
 A = Q*T*Q**H, so that the diagonal element of T with row index IFST
 is moved to row ILST.

 The Schur form T is reordered by a unitary similarity transformation
 Z**H*T*Z, and optionally the matrix Q of Schur vectors is updated by
 postmultiplying it with Z.

## Parameters

### COMPQ (in)

COMPQ is CHARACTER*1 = 'V': update the matrix Q of Schur vectors; = 'N': do not update Q.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix T. N >= 0. If N == 0 arguments ILST and IFST may be any value.

### T (in,out)

T is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDT,N) On entry, the upper triangular matrix T. On exit, the reordered upper triangular matrix.

### LDT (in)

LDT is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

### Q (in,out)

Q is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDQ,N) On entry, if COMPQ = 'V', the matrix Q of Schur vectors. On exit, if COMPQ = 'V', Q has been postmultiplied by the unitary transformation matrix Z which reorders T. If COMPQ = 'N', Q is not referenced.

### LDQ (in)

LDQ is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= 1, and if COMPQ = 'V', LDQ >= max(1,N).

### IFST (in)

IFST is INTEGER

### ILST (in)

ILST is INTEGER Specify the reordering of the diagonal elements of T: The element with row index IFST is moved to row ILST by a sequence of transpositions between adjacent elements. 1 <= IFST <= N; 1 <= ILST <= N.

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
