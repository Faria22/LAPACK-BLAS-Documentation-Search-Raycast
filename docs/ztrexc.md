subroutine ztrexc (
		character compq,
		integer n,
		complex*16, dimension(ldt, *) t,

```

 ZTREXC reorders the Schur factorization of a complex matrix
 A = Q*T*Q**H, so that the diagonal element of T with row index IFST
 is moved to row ILST.

 The Schur form T is reordered by a unitary similarity transformation
 Z**H*T*Z, and optionally the matrix Q of Schur vectors is updated by
 postmultiplying it with Z.

## Parameters
Compq : Character*1 [in]
> = 'V':  update the matrix Q of Schur vectors;
> = 'N':  do not update Q.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.
> If N == 0 arguments ILST and IFST may be any value.

T : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldt,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper triangular matrix T.
> On exit, the reordered upper triangular matrix.

Ldt : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

Q : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldq,n) [in,out]
> On entry, if COMPQ = 'V', the matrix Q of Schur vectors.
> On exit, if COMPQ = 'V', Q has been postmultiplied by the
> unitary transformation matrix Z which reorders T.
> If COMPQ = 'N', Q is not referenced.

Ldq : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Q.  LDQ >= 1, and if
> COMPQ = 'V', LDQ >= max(1,N).

Ifst : Integer [in]

Ilst : Integer [in]
> Specify the reordering of the diagonal elements of T:
> The element with row index IFST is moved to row ILST by a
> sequence of transpositions between adjacent elements.
> 1 <= IFST <= N; 1 <= ILST <= N.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
