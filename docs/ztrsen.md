 ZTRSEN reorders the Schur factorization of a complex matrix
 A = Q*T*Q**H, so that a selected cluster of eigenvalues appears in
 the leading positions on the diagonal of the upper triangular matrix
 T, and the leading columns of Q form an orthonormal basis of the
 corresponding right invariant subspace.

 Optionally the routine computes the reciprocal condition numbers of
 the cluster of eigenvalues and/or the invariant subspace.

## Parameters
Job : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies whether condition numbers are required for the
> cluster of eigenvalues (S) or the invariant subspace (SEP):
> = 'N': none;
> = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S);
> = 'V': for invariant subspace only (SEP);
> = 'B': for both eigenvalues and invariant subspace (S and
> SEP).

Compq : Character*1 [in]
> = 'V': update the matrix Q of Schur vectors;
> = 'N': do not update Q.

Select : Logical Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> SELECT specifies the eigenvalues in the selected cluster. To
> select the j-th eigenvalue, SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE..

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.

T : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldt,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper triangular matrix T.
> On exit, T is overwritten by the reordered matrix T, with the
> selected eigenvalues as the leading diagonal elements.

Ldt : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

Q : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldq,n) [in,out]
> On entry, if COMPQ = 'V', the matrix Q of Schur vectors.
> On exit, if COMPQ = 'V', Q has been postmultiplied by the
> unitary transformation matrix which reorders T; the leading M
> columns of Q form an orthonormal basis for the specified
> invariant subspace.
> If COMPQ = 'N', Q is not referenced.

Ldq : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Q.
> LDQ >= 1; and if COMPQ = 'V', LDQ >= N.

W : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (n) [out]
> The reordered eigenvalues of T, in the same order as they
> appear on the diagonal of T.

M : Integer [out]
> The dimension of the specified invariant subspace.
> 0 <= M <= N.

S : Double Precision [out]
> If JOB = 'E' or 'B', S is a lower bound on the reciprocal
> condition number for the selected cluster of eigenvalues.
> S cannot underestimate the true reciprocal condition number
> by more than a factor of sqrt(N). If M = 0 or N, S = 1.
> If JOB = 'N' or 'V', S is not referenced.

Sep : Double Precision [out]
> If JOB = 'V' or 'B', SEP is the estimated reciprocal
> condition number of the specified invariant subspace. If
> M = 0 or N, SEP = norm(T).
> If JOB = 'N' or 'E', SEP is not referenced.

Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If JOB = 'N', LWORK >= 1;
> if JOB = 'E', LWORK = max(1,M*(N-M));
> if JOB = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= max(1,2*M*(N-M)).
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
