 CTPQRT computes a blocked QR factorization of a complex
 "triangular-pentagonal" matrix C, which is composed of a
 triangular block A and pentagonal block B, using the compact
 WY representation for Q.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix B.
> M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix B, and the order of the
> triangular matrix A.
> N >= 0.

L : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the upper trapezoidal part of B.
> MIN(M,N) >= L >= 0.  See Further Details.

Nb : Integer [in]
> The block size to be used in the blocked QR.  N >= NB >= 1.

A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper triangular N-by-N matrix A.
> On exit, the elements on and above the diagonal of the array
> contain the upper triangular matrix R.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

B : Complex Array, Dimension (ldb,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the pentagonal M-by-N matrix B.  The first M-L rows
> are rectangular, and the last L rows are upper trapezoidal.
> On exit, B contains the pentagonal matrix V.  See Further Details.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,M).

T : Complex Array, Dimension (ldt,n) [out]
> The upper triangular block reflectors stored in compact form
> as a sequence of upper triangular blocks.  See Further Details.

Ldt : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T.  LDT >= NB.

Work : Complex Array, Dimension (nb*n) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
