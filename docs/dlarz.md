```fortran
subroutine dlarz	(	character	side,
		integer	m,
		integer	n,
		integer	l,

		double precision, dimension(ldc, *)	c,

```

 DLARZ applies a real elementary reflector H to a real M-by-N
 matrix C, from either the left or the right. H is represented in the
 form

       H = I - tau * v * v**T

 where tau is a real scalar and v is a real vector.

 If tau = 0, then H is taken to be the unit matrix.


 H is a product of k elementary reflectors as returned by DTZRZF.

## Parameters
Side : Character*1 [in]
> = 'L': form  H * C
> = 'R': form  C * H

M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix C.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix C.

L : Integer [in]
> The number of entries of the vector V containing
> the meaningful part of the Householder vectors.
> If SIDE = 'L', M >= L >= 0, if SIDE = 'R', N >= L >= 0.

V : Double Precision Array, Dimension (1+(l-1)*abs(incv)) [in]
> The vector v in the representation of H as returned by
> DTZRZF. V is not used if TAU = 0.

Incv : Integer [in]
> The increment between elements of v. INCV <> 0.

Tau : Double Precision [in]
> The value tau in the representation of H.

C : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldc,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix C.
> On exit, C is overwritten by the matrix H * C if SIDE = 'L',
> or C * H if SIDE = 'R'.

Ldc : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M).

Work : Double Precision Array, Dimension [out]
> (N) if SIDE = 'L'
> or (M) if SIDE = 'R'
