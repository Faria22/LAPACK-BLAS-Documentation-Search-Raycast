 CHPGV computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors
 of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem, of the form
 A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.
 Here A and B are assumed to be Hermitian, stored in packed format,
 and B is also positive definite.

## Parameters
Itype : Integer [in]
> Specifies the problem type to be solved:
> = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
> = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
> = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x

Jobz : Character*1 [in]
> = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
> = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

Ap : Complex Array, Dimension (n*(n+1)/2) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
> A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
> is stored in the array AP as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
> On exit, the contents of AP are destroyed.

Bp : Complex Array, Dimension (n*(n+1)/2) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
> B, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of B
> is stored in the array BP as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', BP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = B(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', BP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = B(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
> On exit, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
> factorization B = U**H*U or B = L*L**H, in the same storage
> format as B.

W : Real Array, Dimension (n) [out]
> If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

Z : Complex Array, Dimension (ldz, N) [out]
> If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
> eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
> if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**H*B*Z = I;
> if ITYPE = 3, Z**H*inv(B)*Z = I.
> If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.

Ldz : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
> JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).

Work : Complex Array, Dimension (max(1, 2*n-1)) [out]

Rwork : Real Array, Dimension (max(1, 3*n-2)) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  CPPTRF or CHPEV returned an error code:
> <= N:  if INFO = i, CHPEV failed to converge;
> i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
> tridiagonal form did not convergeto zero;
> > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= n, then the leading
> principal minor of order i of B is not positive.
> The factorization of B could not be completed and
> no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
