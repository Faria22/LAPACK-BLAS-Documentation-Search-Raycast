```fortran
subroutine ztpttr	(	character	uplo,
		integer	n,
		complex*16, dimension(*)	ap,
		complex*16, dimension(lda, *)	a,
		integer	lda,
		integer	info )
```

 ZTPTTR copies a triangular matrix A from standard packed format (TP)
 to standard full format (TR).

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> = 'U':  A is upper triangular.
> = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

Ap : Complex*16 Array, Dimension ( N*(n+1)/2 ), [in]
> On entry, the upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed
> columnwise in a linear array. The j-th column of A is stored
> in the array AP as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension ( Lda, N ) [out]
> On exit, the triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
> N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
> triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
> triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
> leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
> triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
> triangular part of A is not referenced.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
