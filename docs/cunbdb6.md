 CUNBDB6 orthogonalizes the column vector
      X = [ X1 ]
          [ X2 ]
 with respect to the columns of
      Q = [ Q1 ] .
          [ Q2 ]
 The columns of Q must be orthonormal. The orthogonalized vector will
 be zero if and only if it lies entirely in the range of Q.

 The projection is computed with at most two iterations of the
 classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm, see
L. Giraud, J. Langou, M. RozloÅ¾nÃ­k. "On the round-off error
   analysis of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm with reorthogonalization."
