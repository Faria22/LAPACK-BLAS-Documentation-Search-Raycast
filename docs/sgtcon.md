 SGTCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a real
 tridiagonal matrix A using the LU factorization as computed by
 SGTTRF.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

## Parameters
Norm : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
> infinity-norm condition number is required:
> = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
> = 'I':         Infinity-norm.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

Dl : Real Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]
> The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the
> LU factorization of A as computed by SGTTRF.

D : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from
> the LU factorization of A.

Du : Real Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]
> The (n-1) elements of the first superdiagonal of U.

Du2 : Real Array, Dimension (n-2) [in]
> The (n-2) elements of the second superdiagonal of U.

Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
> interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
> i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
> required.

Anorm : Real [in]
> If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
> If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.

Rcond : Real [out]
> The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
> computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
> estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

Work : Real Array, Dimension (2*n) [out]

Iwork : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
