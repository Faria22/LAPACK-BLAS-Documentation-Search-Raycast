 SPFTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a symmetric
 positive definite matrix A using the Cholesky factorization
 A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T computed by SPFTRF.

## Parameters
Transr : Character*1 [in]
> = 'N':  The Normal TRANSR of RFP A is stored;
> = 'T':  The Transpose TRANSR of RFP A is stored.

Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of RFP A is stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of RFP A is stored.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

A : Real Array, Dimension ( N*(n+1)/2 ) [in]
> The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
> of RFP A = U**H*U or RFP A = L*L**T, as computed by SPFTRF.
> See note below for more details about RFP A.

B : Real Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
> On exit, the solution matrix X.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
