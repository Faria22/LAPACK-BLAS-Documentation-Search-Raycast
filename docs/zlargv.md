 ZLARGV generates a vector of complex plane rotations with real
 cosines, determined by elements of the complex vectors x and y.
 For i = 1,2,...,n

    (        c(i)   s(i) ) ( x(i) ) = ( r(i) )
    ( -conjg(s(i))  c(i) ) ( y(i) ) = (   0  )

    where c(i)**2 + ABS(s(i))**2 = 1

 The following conventions are used (these are the same as in ZLARTG,
 but differ from the BLAS1 routine ZROTG):
    If y(i)=0, then c(i)=1 and s(i)=0.
    If x(i)=0, then c(i)=0 and s(i) is chosen so that r(i) is real.

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The number of plane rotations to be generated.

X : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (1+(n-1)*incx) [in,out]
> On entry, the vector x.
> On exit, x(i) is overwritten by r(i), for i = 1,...,n.

Incx : Integer [in]
> The increment between elements of X. INCX > 0.

Y : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (1+(n-1)*incy) [in,out]
> On entry, the vector y.
> On exit, the sines of the plane rotations.

Incy : Integer [in]
> The increment between elements of Y. INCY > 0.

C : Double Precision Array, Dimension (1+(n-1)*incc) [out]
> The cosines of the plane rotations.

Incc : Integer [in]
> The increment between elements of C. INCC > 0.
