# CTBSV

## Function Signature

```fortran
CTBSV(UPLO,TRANS,DIAG,N,K,A,LDA,X,INCX)
```

## Description


 CTBSV  solves one of the systems of equations

    A*x = b,   or   A**T*x = b,   or   A**H*x = b,

 where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
 non-unit, upper or lower triangular band matrix, with ( k + 1 )
 diagonals.

 No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
 routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is CHARACTER*1 On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or lower triangular matrix as follows: UPLO = 'U' or 'u' A is an upper triangular matrix. UPLO = 'L' or 'l' A is a lower triangular matrix.

### TRANS (in)

TRANS is CHARACTER*1 On entry, TRANS specifies the equations to be solved as follows: TRANS = 'N' or 'n' A*x = b. TRANS = 'T' or 't' A**T*x = b. TRANS = 'C' or 'c' A**H*x = b.

### DIAG (in)

DIAG is CHARACTER*1 On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangular as follows: DIAG = 'U' or 'u' A is assumed to be unit triangular. DIAG = 'N' or 'n' A is not assumed to be unit triangular.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at least zero.

### K (in)

K is INTEGER On entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', K specifies the number of super-diagonals of the matrix A. On entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', K specifies the number of sub-diagonals of the matrix A. K must satisfy 0 .le. K.

### A (in)

A is COMPLEX array, dimension ( LDA, N ) Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading ( k + 1 ) by n part of the array A must contain the upper triangular band part of the matrix of coefficients, supplied column by column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row ( k + 1 ) of the array, the first super-diagonal starting at position 2 in row k, and so on. The top left k by k triangle of the array A is not referenced. The following program segment will transfer an upper triangular band matrix from conventional full matrix storage to band storage: DO 20, J = 1, N M = K + 1 - J DO 10, I = MAX( 1, J - K ), J A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J ) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading ( k + 1 ) by n part of the array A must contain the lower triangular band part of the matrix of coefficients, supplied column by column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row 1 of the array, the first sub-diagonal starting at position 1 in row 2, and so on. The bottom right k by k triangle of the array A is not referenced. The following program segment will transfer a lower triangular band matrix from conventional full matrix storage to band storage: DO 20, J = 1, N M = 1 - J DO 10, I = J, MIN( N, J + K ) A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J ) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE Note that when DIAG = 'U' or 'u' the elements of the array A corresponding to the diagonal elements of the matrix are not referenced, but are assumed to be unity.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least ( k + 1 ).

### X (in,out)

X is COMPLEX array, dimension at least ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ). Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten with the solution vector x.

### INCX (in)

INCX is INTEGER On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X. INCX must not be zero.
