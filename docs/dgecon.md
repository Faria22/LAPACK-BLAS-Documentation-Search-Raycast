# DGECON

## Function Signature

```fortran
DGECON(NORM, N, A, LDA, ANORM, RCOND, WORK, IWORK,
*                          INFO)
```

## Description


 DGECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a general
 real matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm, using
 the LU factorization computed by DGETRF.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as
    RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).

## Parameters

### NORM (in)

NORM is CHARACTER*1 Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the infinity-norm condition number is required: = '1' or 'O': 1-norm; = 'I': Infinity-norm.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

### A (in)

A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N) The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U as computed by DGETRF.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).

### ANORM (in)

ANORM is DOUBLE PRECISION If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A. If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.

### RCOND (out)

RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A, computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).

### WORK (out)

WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)

### IWORK (out)

IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value. NaNs are illegal values for ANORM, and they propagate to the output parameter RCOND. Infinity is illegal for ANORM, and it propagates to the output parameter RCOND as 0. = 1: if RCOND = NaN, or RCOND = Inf, or the computed norm of the inverse of A is 0. In the latter, RCOND = 0 is returned.
