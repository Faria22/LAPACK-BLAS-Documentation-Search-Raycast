# ZPSTRF

## Function Signature

```fortran
ZPSTRF(UPLO, N, A, LDA, PIV, RANK, TOL, WORK, INFO)
```

## Description


 ZPSTRF computes the Cholesky factorization with complete
 pivoting of a complex Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix A.

 The factorization has the form
    P**T * A * P = U**H * U ,  if UPLO = 'U',
    P**T * A * P = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular, and
 P is stored as vector PIV.

 This algorithm does not attempt to check that A is positive
 semidefinite. This version of the algorithm calls level 3 BLAS.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is CHARACTER*1 Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the symmetric matrix A is stored. = 'U': Upper triangular = 'L': Lower triangular

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

### A (in,out)

A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N) On entry, the symmetric matrix A. If UPLO = 'U', the leading n by n upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not referenced. If UPLO = 'L', the leading n by n lower triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization as above.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).

### PIV (out)

PIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N) PIV is such that the nonzero entries are P( PIV(K), K ) = 1.

### RANK (out)

RANK is INTEGER The rank of A given by the number of steps the algorithm completed.

### TOL (in)

TOL is DOUBLE PRECISION User defined tolerance. If TOL < 0, then N*U*MAX( A(K,K) ) will be used. The algorithm terminates at the (K-1)st step if the pivot <= TOL.

### WORK (out)

WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*N) Work space.

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER < 0: If INFO = -K, the K-th argument had an illegal value, = 0: algorithm completed successfully, and > 0: the matrix A is either rank deficient with computed rank as returned in RANK, or is not positive semidefinite.
