 SSTEDC computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
 symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the divide and conquer method.
 The eigenvectors of a full or band real symmetric matrix can also be
 found if SSYTRD or SSPTRD or SSBTRD has been used to reduce this
 matrix to tridiagonal form.


## Parameters
Compz : Character*1 [in]
> = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.
> = 'I':  Compute eigenvectors of tridiagonal matrix also.
> = 'V':  Compute eigenvectors of original dense symmetric
> matrix also.  On entry, Z contains the orthogonal
> matrix used to reduce the original matrix to
> tridiagonal form.

N : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.  N >= 0.

D : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> On entry, the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
> On exit, if INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

E : Real Array, Dimension (n-1) [in,out]
> On entry, the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
> On exit, E has been destroyed.

Z : Real Array, Dimension (ldz,n) [in,out]
> On entry, if COMPZ = 'V', then Z contains the orthogonal
> matrix used in the reduction to tridiagonal form.
> On exit, if INFO = 0, then if COMPZ = 'V', Z contains the
> orthonormal eigenvectors of the original symmetric matrix,
> and if COMPZ = 'I', Z contains the orthonormal eigenvectors
> of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
> If  COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.

Ldz : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1.
> If eigenvectors are desired, then LDZ >= max(1,N).

Work : Real Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If COMPZ = 'N' or N <= 1 then LWORK must be at least 1.
> If COMPZ = 'V' and N > 1 then LWORK must be at least
> ( 1 + 3*N + 2*N*lg N + 4*N**2 ),
> where lg( N ) = smallest integer k such
> that 2**k >= N.
> If COMPZ = 'I' and N > 1 then LWORK must be at least
> ( 1 + 4*N + N**2 ).
> Note that for COMPZ = 'I' or 'V', then if N is less than or
> equal to the minimum divide size, usually 25, then LWORK need
> only be max(1,2*(N-1)).
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Iwork : Integer Array, Dimension (max(1,liwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.

Liwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array IWORK.
> If COMPZ = 'N' or N <= 1 then LIWORK must be at least 1.
> If COMPZ = 'V' and N > 1 then LIWORK must be at least
> ( 6 + 6*N + 5*N*lg N ).
> If COMPZ = 'I' and N > 1 then LIWORK must be at least
> ( 3 + 5*N ).
> Note that for COMPZ = 'I' or 'V', then if N is less than or
> equal to the minimum divide size, usually 25, then LIWORK
> need only be 1.
> If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
> routine only calculates the optimal size of the IWORK array,
> returns this value as the first entry of the IWORK array, and
> no error message related to LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit.
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
> > 0:  The algorithm failed to compute an eigenvalue while
> working on the submatrix lying in rows and columns
> INFO/(N+1) through mod(INFO,N+1).
