# CLAGS2

## Function Signature

```fortran
CLAGS2(UPPER, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, CSU, SNU, CSV,
*                          SNV, CSQ, SNQ)
```

## Description


 CLAGS2 computes 2-by-2 unitary matrices U, V and Q, such
 that if ( UPPER ) then

           U**H *A*Q = U**H *( A1 A2 )*Q = ( x  0  )
                             ( 0  A3 )     ( x  x  )
 and
           V**H*B*Q = V**H *( B1 B2 )*Q = ( x  0  )
                            ( 0  B3 )     ( x  x  )

 or if ( .NOT.UPPER ) then

           U**H *A*Q = U**H *( A1 0  )*Q = ( x  x  )
                             ( A2 A3 )     ( 0  x  )
 and
           V**H *B*Q = V**H *( B1 0  )*Q = ( x  x  )
                             ( B2 B3 )     ( 0  x  )
 where

   U = (   CSU    SNU ), V = (  CSV    SNV ),
       ( -SNU**H  CSU )      ( -SNV**H CSV )

   Q = (   CSQ    SNQ )
       ( -SNQ**H  CSQ )

 The rows of the transformed A and B are parallel. Moreover, if the
 input 2-by-2 matrix A is not zero, then the transformed (1,1) entry
 of A is not zero. If the input matrices A and B are both not zero,
 then the transformed (2,2) element of B is not zero, except when the
 first rows of input A and B are parallel and the second rows are
 zero.
