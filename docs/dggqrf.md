 DGGQRF computes a generalized QR factorization of an N-by-M matrix A
 and an N-by-P matrix B:

             A = Q*R,        B = Q*T*Z,

 where Q is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix, Z is a P-by-P orthogonal
 matrix, and R and T assume one of the forms:

 if N >= M,  R = ( R11 ) M  ,   or if N < M,  R = ( R11  R12 ) N,
                 (  0  ) N-M                         N   M-N
                    M

 where R11 is upper triangular, and

 if N <= P,  T = ( 0  T12 ) N,   or if N > P,  T = ( T11 ) N-P,
                  P-N  N                           ( T21 ) P
                                                      P

 where T12 or T21 is upper triangular.

 In particular, if B is square and nonsingular, the GQR factorization
 of A and B implicitly gives the QR factorization of inv(B)*A:

              inv(B)*A = Z**T*(inv(T)*R)

 where inv(B) denotes the inverse of the matrix B, and Z**T denotes the
 transpose of the matrix Z.

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrices A and B. N >= 0.

M : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

P : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix B.  P >= 0.

A : Double Precision Array, Dimension (lda,m) [in,out]
> On entry, the N-by-M matrix A.
> On exit, the elements on and above the diagonal of the array
> contain the min(N,M)-by-M upper trapezoidal matrix R (R is
> upper triangular if N >= M); the elements below the diagonal,
> with the array TAUA, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a
> product of min(N,M) elementary reflectors (see Further
> Details).

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).

Taua : Double Precision Array, Dimension (min(n,m)) [out]
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors which
> represent the orthogonal matrix Q (see Further Details).

B : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldb,p) [in,out]
> On entry, the N-by-P matrix B.
> On exit, if N <= P, the upper triangle of the subarray
> B(1:N,P-N+1:P) contains the N-by-N upper triangular matrix T;
> if N > P, the elements on and above the (N-P)-th subdiagonal
> contain the N-by-P upper trapezoidal matrix T; the remaining
> elements, with the array TAUB, represent the orthogonal
> matrix Z as a product of elementary reflectors (see Further
> Details).

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).

Taub : Double Precision Array, Dimension (min(n,p)) [out]
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors which
> represent the orthogonal matrix Z (see Further Details).

Work : Double Precision Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,N,M,P).
> For optimum performance LWORK >= max(N,M,P)*max(NB1,NB2,NB3),
> where NB1 is the optimal blocksize for the QR factorization
> of an N-by-M matrix, NB2 is the optimal blocksize for the
> RQ factorization of an N-by-P matrix, and NB3 is the optimal
> blocksize for a call of DORMQR.
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
