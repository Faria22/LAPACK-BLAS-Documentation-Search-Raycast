 DLATSQR computes a blocked Tall-Skinny QR factorization of
 a real M-by-N matrix A for M >= N:

    A = Q * ( R ),
            ( 0 )

 where:

    Q is a M-by-M orthogonal matrix, stored on exit in an implicit
    form in the elements below the diagonal of the array A and in
    the elements of the array T;

    R is an upper-triangular N-by-N matrix, stored on exit in
    the elements on and above the diagonal of the array A.

    0 is a (M-N)-by-N zero matrix, and is not stored.


## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A. M >= N >= 0.

Mb : Integer [in]
> The row block size to be used in the blocked QR.
> MB > 0.

Nb : Integer [in]
> The column block size to be used in the blocked QR.
> N >= NB >= 1.

A : Double Precision Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
> On exit, the elements on and above the diagonal
> of the array contain the N-by-N upper triangular matrix R;
> the elements below the diagonal represent Q by the columns
> of blocked V (see Further Details).

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).

T : Double Precision Array, [out]
> dimension (LDT, N * Number_of_row_blocks)
> where Number_of_row_blocks = CEIL((M-N)/(MB-N))
> The blocked upper triangular block reflectors stored in compact form
> as a sequence of upper triangular blocks.
> See Further Details below.

Ldt : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T.  LDT >= NB.

Work : (workspace) Double Precision Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the minimal LWORK.

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> LWORK >= 1, if MIN(M,N) = 0, and LWORK >= NB*N, otherwise.
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the minimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
