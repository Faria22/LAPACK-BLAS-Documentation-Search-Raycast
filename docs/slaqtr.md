 SLAQTR solves the real quasi-triangular system

              op(T)*p = scale*c,               if LREAL = .TRUE.

 or the complex quasi-triangular systems

            op(T + iB)*(p+iq) = scale*(c+id),  if LREAL = .FALSE.

 in real arithmetic, where T is upper quasi-triangular.
 If LREAL = .FALSE., then the first diagonal block of T must be
 1 by 1, B is the specially structured matrix

                B = [ b(1) b(2) ... b(n) ]
                    [       w            ]
                    [           w        ]
                    [              .     ]
                    [                 w  ]

 op(A) = A or A**T, A**T denotes the transpose of
 matrix A.

 On input, X = [ c ].  On output, X = [ p ].
               [ d ]                  [ q ]

 This subroutine is designed for the condition number estimation
 in routine STRSNA.

## Parameters
Ltran : Logical [in]
> On entry, LTRAN specifies the option of conjugate transpose:
> = .FALSE.,    op(T+i*B) = T+i*B,
> = .TRUE.,     op(T+i*B) = (T+i*B)**T.

Lreal : Logical [in]
> On entry, LREAL specifies the input matrix structure:
> = .FALSE.,    the input is complex
> = .TRUE.,     the input is real

N : Integer [in]
> On entry, N specifies the order of T+i*B. N >= 0.

T : Real Array, Dimension (ldt,n) [in]
> On entry, T contains a matrix in Schur canonical form.
> If LREAL = .FALSE., then the first diagonal block of T must
> be 1 by 1.

Ldt : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the matrix T. LDT >= max(1,N).

B : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> On entry, B contains the elements to form the matrix
> B as described above.
> If LREAL = .TRUE., B is not referenced.

W : Real [in]
> On entry, W is the diagonal element of the matrix B.
> If LREAL = .TRUE., W is not referenced.

Scale : Real [out]
> On exit, SCALE is the scale factor.

X : Real Array, Dimension (2*n) [in,out]
> On entry, X contains the right hand side of the system.
> On exit, X is overwritten by the solution.

Work : Real Array, Dimension (n) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> On exit, INFO is set to
> 0: successful exit.
> 1: the some diagonal 1 by 1 block has been perturbed by
> a small number SMIN to keep nonsingularity.
> 2: the some diagonal 2 by 2 block has been perturbed by
> a small number in SLALN2 to keep nonsingularity.
> NOTE: In the interests of speed, this routine does not
> check the inputs for errors.
