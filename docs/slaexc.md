# SLAEXC

## Function Signature

```fortran
SLAEXC(WANTQ, N, T, LDT, Q, LDQ, J1, N1, N2, WORK,
*                          INFO)
```

## Description


 SLAEXC swaps adjacent diagonal blocks T11 and T22 of order 1 or 2 in
 an upper quasi-triangular matrix T by an orthogonal similarity
 transformation.

 T must be in Schur canonical form, that is, block upper triangular
 with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each 2-by-2 diagonal block
 has its diagonal elements equal and its off-diagonal elements of
 opposite sign.

## Parameters

### WANTQ (in)

WANTQ is LOGICAL = .TRUE. : accumulate the transformation in the matrix Q; = .FALSE.: do not accumulate the transformation.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.

### T (in,out)

T is REAL array, dimension (LDT,N) On entry, the upper quasi-triangular matrix T, in Schur canonical form. On exit, the updated matrix T, again in Schur canonical form.

### LDT (in)

LDT is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

### Q (in,out)

Q is REAL array, dimension (LDQ,N) On entry, if WANTQ is .TRUE., the orthogonal matrix Q. On exit, if WANTQ is .TRUE., the updated matrix Q. If WANTQ is .FALSE., Q is not referenced.

### LDQ (in)

LDQ is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= 1; and if WANTQ is .TRUE., LDQ >= N.

### J1 (in)

J1 is INTEGER The index of the first row of the first block T11.

### N1 (in)

N1 is INTEGER The order of the first block T11. N1 = 0, 1 or 2.

### N2 (in)

N2 is INTEGER The order of the second block T22. N2 = 0, 1 or 2.

### WORK (out)

WORK is REAL array, dimension (N)

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit = 1: the transformed matrix T would be too far from Schur form; the blocks are not swapped and T and Q are unchanged.
