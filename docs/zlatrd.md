# ZLATRD

## Function Signature

```fortran
ZLATRD(UPLO, N, NB, A, LDA, E, TAU, W, LDW)
```

## Description


 ZLATRD reduces NB rows and columns of a complex Hermitian matrix A to
 Hermitian tridiagonal form by a unitary similarity
 transformation Q**H * A * Q, and returns the matrices V and W which are
 needed to apply the transformation to the unreduced part of A.

 If UPLO = 'U', ZLATRD reduces the last NB rows and columns of a
 matrix, of which the upper triangle is supplied;
 if UPLO = 'L', ZLATRD reduces the first NB rows and columns of a
 matrix, of which the lower triangle is supplied.

 This is an auxiliary routine called by ZHETRD.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is CHARACTER*1 Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the Hermitian matrix A is stored: = 'U': Upper triangular = 'L': Lower triangular

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix A.

### NB (in)

NB is INTEGER The number of rows and columns to be reduced.

### A (in,out)

A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N) On entry, the Hermitian matrix A. If UPLO = 'U', the leading n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not referenced. If UPLO = 'L', the leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit: if UPLO = 'U', the last NB columns have been reduced to tridiagonal form, with the diagonal elements overwriting the diagonal elements of A; the elements above the diagonal with the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO = 'L', the first NB columns have been reduced to tridiagonal form, with the diagonal elements overwriting the diagonal elements of A; the elements below the diagonal with the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).

### E (out)

E is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1) If UPLO = 'U', E(n-nb:n-1) contains the superdiagonal elements of the last NB columns of the reduced matrix; if UPLO = 'L', E(1:nb) contains the subdiagonal elements of the first NB columns of the reduced matrix.

### TAU (out)

TAU is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1) The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors, stored in TAU(n-nb:n-1) if UPLO = 'U', and in TAU(1:nb) if UPLO = 'L'. See Further Details.

### W (out)

W is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDW,NB) The n-by-nb matrix W required to update the unreduced part of A.

### LDW (in)

LDW is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array W. LDW >= max(1,N).
