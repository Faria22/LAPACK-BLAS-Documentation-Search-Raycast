 CGEMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

    C := alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C,

 where  op( X ) is one of

    op( X ) = X   or   op( X ) = X**T   or   op( X ) = X**H,

 alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B and C are matrices, with op( A )
 an m by k matrix,  op( B )  a  k by n matrix and  C an m by n matrix.

 Note: if alpha and/or beta is zero, some parts of the matrix-matrix
  operations are not performed. This results in the following NaN/Inf
  propagation quirks:

  1. If alpha is zero, NaNs or Infs in A or B do not affect the result.
  2. If both alpha and beta are zero, then a zero matrix is returned in C,
   irrespective of any NaNs or Infs in A, B or C.
  3. If only beta is zero, alpha*op( A )*op( B ) is returned, irrespective
   of any NaNs or Infs in C.

## Parameters
Transa : Character*1 [in]
> On entry, TRANSA specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
> the matrix multiplication as follows:
> TRANSA = 'N' or 'n',  op( A ) = A.
> TRANSA = 'T' or 't',  op( A ) = A**T.
> TRANSA = 'C' or 'c',  op( A ) = A**H.

Transb : Character*1 [in]
> On entry, TRANSB specifies the form of op( B ) to be used in
> the matrix multiplication as follows:
> TRANSB = 'N' or 'n',  op( B ) = B.
> TRANSB = 'T' or 't',  op( B ) = B**T.
> TRANSB = 'C' or 'c',  op( B ) = B**H.

M : Integer [in]
> On entry,  M  specifies  the number  of rows  of the  matrix
> op( A )  and of the  matrix  C.  M  must  be at least  zero.

N : Integer [in]
> On entry,  N  specifies the number  of columns of the matrix
> op( B ) and the number of columns of the matrix C. N must be
> at least zero.

K : Integer [in]
> On entry,  K  specifies  the number of columns of the matrix
> op( A ) and the number of rows of the matrix op( B ). K must
> be at least  zero.

Alpha : Complex [in]
> On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha. If ALPHA is zero the
> values in A and B do not affect the result. This also means that
> NaN/Inf propagation from A and B is inhibited if ALPHA is zero.

A : Complex Array, Dimension ( Lda, Ka ), Where Ka is [in]
> k  when  TRANSA = 'N' or 'n',  and is  m  otherwise.
> Before entry with  TRANSA = 'N' or 'n',  the leading  m by k
> part of the array  A  must contain the matrix  A,  otherwise
> the leading  k by m  part of the array  A  must contain  the
> matrix A, except if ALPHA is zero.
> If ALPHA is zero, none of the values in A affect the result, even
> if they are NaN/Inf. This also implies that if ALPHA is zero,
> the matrix elements of A need not be initialized by the caller.

Lda : Integer [in]
> On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
> in the calling (sub) program. When  TRANSA = 'N' or 'n' then
> LDA must be at least  max( 1, m ), otherwise  LDA must be at
> least  max( 1, k ).

B : Complex Array, Dimension ( Ldb, Kb ), Where Kb is [in]
> n  when  TRANSB = 'N' or 'n',  and is  k  otherwise.
> Before entry with  TRANSB = 'N' or 'n',  the leading  k by n
> part of the array  B  must contain the matrix  B,  otherwise
> the leading  n by k  part of the array  B  must contain  the
> matrix B, except if ALPHA is zero.
> If ALPHA is zero, none of the values in B affect the result, even
> if they are NaN/Inf. This also implies that if ALPHA is zero,
> the matrix elements of B need not be initialized by the caller.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
> in the calling (sub) program. When  TRANSB = 'N' or 'n' then
> LDB must be at least  max( 1, k ), otherwise  LDB must be at
> least  max( 1, n ).

Beta : Complex [in]
> On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta. If BETA is zero the
> values in C do not affect the result. This also means that
> NaN/Inf propagation from C is inhibited if BETA is zero.

C : Complex Array, Dimension ( Ldc, N ) [in,out]
> Before entry, the leading  m by n  part of the array  C must
> contain the matrix  C, except if beta is zero.
> If beta is zero, none of the values in C affect the result, even
> if they are NaN/Inf. This also implies that if beta is zero,
> the matrix elements of C need not be initialized by the caller.
> On exit, the array  C  is overwritten by the  m by n  matrix
> ( alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C ).

Ldc : Integer [in]
> On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
> in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
> max( 1, m ).
