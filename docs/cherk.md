subroutine cherk (
		character uplo,
		character trans,

 CHERK  performs one of the hermitian rank k operations

    C := alpha*A*A**H + beta*C,

 or

    C := alpha*A**H*A + beta*C,

 where  alpha and beta  are  real scalars,  C is an  n by n  hermitian
 matrix and  A  is an  n by k  matrix in the  first case and a  k by n
 matrix in the second case.

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower
> triangular  part  of the  array  C  is to be  referenced  as
> follows:
> UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the  upper triangular part of  C
> is to be referenced.
> UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the  lower triangular part of  C
> is to be referenced.

Trans : Character*1 [in]
> On entry,  TRANS  specifies the operation to be performed as
> follows:
> TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   C := alpha*A*A**H + beta*C.
> TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   C := alpha*A**H*A + beta*C.

N : Integer [in]
> On entry,  N specifies the order of the matrix C.  N must be
> at least zero.

K : Integer [in]
> On entry with  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  K  specifies  the number
> of  columns   of  the   matrix   A,   and  on   entry   with
> TRANS = 'C' or 'c',  K  specifies  the number of rows of the
> matrix A.  K must be at least zero.

Alpha : Real [in]
> On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.

A : Complex Array, Dimension ( Lda, Ka ), Where Ka is [in]
> k  when  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  and is  n  otherwise.
> Before entry with  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  the  leading  n by k
> part of the array  A  must contain the matrix  A,  otherwise
> the leading  k by n  part of the array  A  must contain  the
> matrix A.

Lda : Integer [in]
> On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
> in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   When  TRANS = 'N' or 'n'
> then  LDA must be at least  max( 1, n ), otherwise  LDA must
> be at least  max( 1, k ).

Beta : Real [in]
> On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta.

C : Complex Array, Dimension ( Ldc, N ) [in,out]
> Before entry  with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the leading  n by n
> upper triangular part of the array C must contain the upper
> triangular part  of the  hermitian matrix  and the strictly
> lower triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the
> upper triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
> upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
> Before entry  with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',  the leading  n by n
> lower triangular part of the array C must contain the lower
> triangular part  of the  hermitian matrix  and the strictly
> upper triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the
> lower triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
> lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
> Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
> not be set,  they are assumed to be zero,  and on exit they
> are set to zero.

Ldc : Integer [in]
> On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
> in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
> max( 1, n ).
