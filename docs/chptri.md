 CHPTRI computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix
 A in packed storage using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
 A = L*D*L**H computed by CHPTRF.

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

Ap : Complex Array, Dimension (n*(n+1)/2) [in,out]
> On entry, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
> used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by CHPTRF,
> stored as a packed triangular matrix.
> On exit, if INFO = 0, the (Hermitian) inverse of the original
> matrix, stored as a packed triangular matrix. The j-th column
> of inv(A) is stored in the array AP as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = inv(A)(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L',
> AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = inv(A)(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
> as determined by CHPTRF.

Work : Complex Array, Dimension (n) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
> inverse could not be computed.
