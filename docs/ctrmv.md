# CTRMV

## Function Signature

```fortran
CTRMV(UPLO,TRANS,DIAG,N,A,LDA,X,INCX)
```

## Description


 CTRMV  performs one of the matrix-vector operations

    x := A*x,   or   x := A**T*x,   or   x := A**H*x,

 where x is an n element vector and  A is an n by n unit, or non-unit,
 upper or lower triangular matrix.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is CHARACTER*1 On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or lower triangular matrix as follows: UPLO = 'U' or 'u' A is an upper triangular matrix. UPLO = 'L' or 'l' A is a lower triangular matrix.

### TRANS (in)

TRANS is CHARACTER*1 On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as follows: TRANS = 'N' or 'n' x := A*x. TRANS = 'T' or 't' x := A**T*x. TRANS = 'C' or 'c' x := A**H*x.

### DIAG (in)

DIAG is CHARACTER*1 On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangular as follows: DIAG = 'U' or 'u' A is assumed to be unit triangular. DIAG = 'N' or 'n' A is not assumed to be unit triangular.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at least zero.

### A (in)

A is COMPLEX array, dimension ( LDA, N ). Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not referenced. Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower triangular matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced. Note that when DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced either, but are assumed to be unity.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least max( 1, n ).

### X (in,out)

X is COMPLEX array, dimension at least ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ). Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n element vector x. On exit, X is overwritten with the transformed vector x.

### INCX (in)

INCX is INTEGER On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X. INCX must not be zero.
