# DSYRK

## Function Signature

```fortran
DSYRK(UPLO,TRANS,N,K,ALPHA,A,LDA,BETA,C,LDC)
```

## Description


 DSYRK  performs one of the symmetric rank k operations

    C := alpha*A*A**T + beta*C,

 or

    C := alpha*A**T*A + beta*C,

 where  alpha and beta  are scalars, C is an  n by n  symmetric matrix
 and  A  is an  n by k  matrix in the first case and a  k by n  matrix
 in the second case.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is CHARACTER*1 On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the array C is to be referenced as follows: UPLO = 'U' or 'u' Only the upper triangular part of C is to be referenced. UPLO = 'L' or 'l' Only the lower triangular part of C is to be referenced.

### TRANS (in)

TRANS is CHARACTER*1 On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as follows: TRANS = 'N' or 'n' C := alpha*A*A**T + beta*C. TRANS = 'T' or 't' C := alpha*A**T*A + beta*C. TRANS = 'C' or 'c' C := alpha*A**T*A + beta*C.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix C. N must be at least zero.

### K (in)

K is INTEGER On entry with TRANS = 'N' or 'n', K specifies the number of columns of the matrix A, and on entry with TRANS = 'T' or 't' or 'C' or 'c', K specifies the number of rows of the matrix A. K must be at least zero.

### ALPHA (in)

ALPHA is DOUBLE PRECISION. On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.

### A (in)

A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( LDA, ka ), where ka is k when TRANS = 'N' or 'n', and is n otherwise. Before entry with TRANS = 'N' or 'n', the leading n by k part of the array A must contain the matrix A, otherwise the leading k by n part of the array A must contain the matrix A.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared in the calling (sub) program. When TRANS = 'N' or 'n' then LDA must be at least max( 1, n ), otherwise LDA must be at least max( 1, k ).

### BETA (in)

BETA is DOUBLE PRECISION. On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta.

### C (in,out)

C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( LDC, N ) Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n upper triangular part of the array C must contain the upper triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of C is not referenced. On exit, the upper triangular part of the array C is overwritten by the upper triangular part of the updated matrix. Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n lower triangular part of the array C must contain the lower triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of C is not referenced. On exit, the lower triangular part of the array C is overwritten by the lower triangular part of the updated matrix.

### LDC (in)

LDC is INTEGER On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared in the calling (sub) program. LDC must be at least max( 1, n ).
