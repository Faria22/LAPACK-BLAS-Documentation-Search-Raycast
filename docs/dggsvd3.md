## Description


 DGGSVD3 computes the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)
 of an M-by-N real matrix A and P-by-N real matrix B:

       U**T*A*Q = D1*( 0 R ),    V**T*B*Q = D2*( 0 R )

 where U, V and Q are orthogonal matrices.
 Let K+L = the effective numerical rank of the matrix (A**T,B**T)**T,
 then R is a K+L-by-K+L nonsingular upper triangular matrix, D1 and
 D2 are M-by-(K+L) and P-by-(K+L) "diagonal" matrices and of the
 following structures, respectively:

 If M-K-L >= 0,

                     K  L
        D1 =     K ( I  0 )
                 L ( 0  C )
             M-K-L ( 0  0 )

                   K  L
        D2 =   L ( 0  S )
             P-L ( 0  0 )

                 N-K-L  K    L
   ( 0 R ) = K (  0   R11  R12 )
             L (  0    0   R22 )

 where

   C = diag( ALPHA(K+1), ... , ALPHA(K+L) ),
   S = diag( BETA(K+1),  ... , BETA(K+L) ),
   C**2 + S**2 = I.

   R is stored in A(1:K+L,N-K-L+1:N) on exit.

 If M-K-L < 0,

                   K M-K K+L-M
        D1 =   K ( I  0    0   )
             M-K ( 0  C    0   )

                     K M-K K+L-M
        D2 =   M-K ( 0  S    0  )
             K+L-M ( 0  0    I  )
               P-L ( 0  0    0  )

                    N-K-L  K   M-K  K+L-M
   ( 0 R ) =     K ( 0    R11  R12  R13  )
               M-K ( 0     0   R22  R23  )
             K+L-M ( 0     0    0   R33  )

 where

   C = diag( ALPHA(K+1), ... , ALPHA(M) ),
   S = diag( BETA(K+1),  ... , BETA(M) ),
   C**2 + S**2 = I.

   (R11 R12 R13 ) is stored in A(1:M, N-K-L+1:N), and R33 is stored
   ( 0  R22 R23 )
   in B(M-K+1:L,N+M-K-L+1:N) on exit.

 The routine computes C, S, R, and optionally the orthogonal
 transformation matrices U, V and Q.

 In particular, if B is an N-by-N nonsingular matrix, then the GSVD of
 A and B implicitly gives the SVD of A*inv(B):
                      A*inv(B) = U*(D1*inv(D2))*V**T.
 If ( A**T,B**T)**T  has orthonormal columns, then the GSVD of A and B is
 also equal to the CS decomposition of A and B. Furthermore, the GSVD
 can be used to derive the solution of the eigenvalue problem:
                      A**T*A x = lambda* B**T*B x.
 In some literature, the GSVD of A and B is presented in the form
                  U**T*A*X = ( 0 D1 ),   V**T*B*X = ( 0 D2 )
 where U and V are orthogonal and X is nonsingular, D1 and D2 are
 ``diagonal''.  The former GSVD form can be converted to the latter
 form by taking the nonsingular matrix X as

                      X = Q*( I   0    )
                            ( 0 inv(R) ).
