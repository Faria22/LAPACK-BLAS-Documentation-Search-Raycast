 CLAQP2RK computes a truncated (rank K) or full rank Householder QR
 factorization with column pivoting of the complex matrix
 block A(IOFFSET+1:M,1:N) as

   A * P(K) = Q(K) * R(K).

 The routine uses Level 2 BLAS. The block A(1:IOFFSET,1:N)
 is accordingly pivoted, but not factorized.

 The routine also overwrites the right-hand-sides matrix block B
 stored in A(IOFFSET+1:M,N+1:N+NRHS) with Q(K)**H * B.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A. N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
> columns of the matrix B. NRHS >= 0.

Ioffset : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A that must be pivoted
> but not factorized. IOFFSET >= 0.
> IOFFSET also represents the number of columns of the whole
> original matrix A_orig that have been factorized
> in the previous steps.

Kmax : Integer [in]
> The first factorization stopping criterion. KMAX >= 0.
> The maximum number of columns of the matrix A to factorize,
> i.e. the maximum factorization rank.
> a) If KMAX >= min(M-IOFFSET,N), then this stopping
> criterion is not used, factorize columns
> depending on ABSTOL and RELTOL.
> b) If KMAX = 0, then this stopping criterion is
> satisfied on input and the routine exits immediately.
> This means that the factorization is not performed,
> the matrices A and B and the arrays TAU, IPIV
> are not modified.

Abstol : Real, Cannot Be Nan. [in]
> The second factorization stopping criterion.
> The absolute tolerance (stopping threshold) for
> maximum column 2-norm of the residual matrix.
> The algorithm converges (stops the factorization) when
> the maximum column 2-norm of the residual matrix
> is less than or equal to ABSTOL.
> a) If ABSTOL < 0.0, then this stopping criterion is not
> used, the routine factorizes columns depending
> on KMAX and RELTOL.
> This includes the case ABSTOL = -Inf.
> b) If 0.0 <= ABSTOL then the input value
> of ABSTOL is used.

Reltol : Real, Cannot Be Nan. [in]
> The third factorization stopping criterion.
> The tolerance (stopping threshold) for the ratio of the
> maximum column 2-norm of the residual matrix to the maximum
> column 2-norm of the original matrix A_orig. The algorithm
> converges (stops the factorization), when this ratio is
> less than or equal to RELTOL.
> a) If RELTOL < 0.0, then this stopping criterion is not
> used, the routine factorizes columns depending
> on KMAX and ABSTOL.
> This includes the case RELTOL = -Inf.
> d) If 0.0 <= RELTOL then the input value of RELTOL
> is used.

Kp1 : Integer [in]
> The index of the column with the maximum 2-norm in
> the whole original matrix A_orig determined in the
> main routine CGEQP3RK. 1 <= KP1 <= N_orig_mat.

Maxc2nrm : Real [in]
> The maximum column 2-norm of the whole original
> matrix A_orig computed in the main routine CGEQP3RK.
> MAXC2NRM >= 0.

A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n+nrhs) [in,out]
> On entry:
> the M-by-N matrix A and M-by-NRHS matrix B, as in
> N     NRHS
> array_A   =   M  [ mat_A, mat_B ]
> On exit:
> 1. The elements in block A(IOFFSET+1:M,1:K) below
> the diagonal together with the array TAU represent
> the unitary matrix Q(K) as a product of elementary
> reflectors.
> 2. The upper triangular block of the matrix A stored
> in A(IOFFSET+1:M,1:K) is the triangular factor obtained.
> 3. The block of the matrix A stored in A(1:IOFFSET,1:N)
> has been accordingly pivoted, but not factorized.
> 4. The rest of the array A, block A(IOFFSET+1:M,K+1:N+NRHS).
> The left part A(IOFFSET+1:M,K+1:N) of this block
> contains the residual of the matrix A, and,
> if NRHS > 0, the right part of the block
> A(IOFFSET+1:M,N+1:N+NRHS) contains the block of
> the right-hand-side matrix B. Both these blocks have been
> updated by multiplication from the left by Q(K)**H.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).

K : Integer [out]
> Factorization rank of the matrix A, i.e. the rank of
> the factor R, which is the same as the number of non-zero
> rows of the factor R. 0 <= K <= min(M-IOFFSET,KMAX,N).
> K also represents the number of non-zero Householder
> vectors.

Maxc2nrmk : Real [out]
> The maximum column 2-norm of the residual matrix,
> when the factorization stopped at rank K. MAXC2NRMK >= 0.

Relmaxc2nrmk : Real [out]
> The ratio MAXC2NRMK / MAXC2NRM of the maximum column
> 2-norm of the residual matrix (when the factorization
> stopped at rank K) to the maximum column 2-norm of the
> whole original matrix A. RELMAXC2NRMK >= 0.

Jpiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [out]
> Column pivot indices, for 1 <= j <= N, column j
> of the matrix A was interchanged with column JPIV(j).

Tau : Complex Array, Dimension (min(m-ioffset,n)) [out]
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors.

Vn1 : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> The vector with the partial column norms.

Vn2 : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> The vector with the exact column norms.

Work : Complex Array, Dimension (n-1) [out]
> Used in CLARF1F subroutine to apply an elementary
> reflector from the left.

Info : Integer [out]
> 1) INFO = 0: successful exit.
> 2) If INFO = j_1, where 1 <= j_1 <= N, then NaN was
> detected and the routine stops the computation.
> The j_1-th column of the matrix A or the j_1-th
> element of array TAU contains the first occurrence
> of NaN in the factorization step K+1 ( when K columns
> have been factorized ).
> On exit:
> K                  is set to the number of
> factorized columns without
> exception.
> MAXC2NRMK          is set to NaN.
> RELMAXC2NRMK       is set to NaN.
> TAU(K+1:min(M,N))  is not set and contains undefined
> elements. If j_1=K+1, TAU(K+1)
> may contain NaN.
> 3) If INFO = j_2, where N+1 <= j_2 <= 2*N, then no NaN
> was detected, but +Inf (or -Inf) was detected and
> the routine continues the computation until completion.
> The (j_2-N)-th column of the matrix A contains the first
> occurrence of +Inf (or -Inf) in the factorization
> step K+1 ( when K columns have been factorized ).
