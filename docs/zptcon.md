 ZPTCON computes the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
 1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite tridiagonal matrix
 using the factorization A = L*D*L**H or A = U**H*D*U computed by
 ZPTTRF.

 Norm(inv(A)) is computed by a direct method, and the reciprocal of
 the condition number is computed as
                  RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

D : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
> factorization of A, as computed by ZPTTRF.

E : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]
> The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
> U or L from the factorization of A, as computed by ZPTTRF.

Anorm : Double Precision [in]
> The 1-norm of the original matrix A.

Rcond : Double Precision [out]
> The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
> computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is the
> 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

Rwork : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
