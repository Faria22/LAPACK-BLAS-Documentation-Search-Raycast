```fortran
subroutine dpotri	(	character	uplo,
		integer	n,
		double precision, dimension(lda, *)	a,
		integer	lda,
		integer	info )
```

 DPOTRI computes the inverse of a real symmetric positive definite
 matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
 computed by DPOTRF.

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : Double Precision Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
> factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by
> DPOTRF.
> On exit, the upper or lower triangle of the (symmetric)
> inverse of A, overwriting the input factor U or L.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
> zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
