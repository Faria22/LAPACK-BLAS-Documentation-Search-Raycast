 CSYTRS_AA_2STAGE solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
 symmetric matrix A using the factorization A = U**T*T*U or
 A = L*T*L**T computed by CSYTRF_AA_2STAGE.

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U**T*T*U;
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*T*L**T.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in]
> Details of factors computed by CSYTRF_AA_2STAGE.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

Tb : Complex Array, Dimension (ltb) [out]
> Details of factors computed by CSYTRF_AA_2STAGE.

Ltb : Integer [in]
> The size of the array TB. LTB >= 4*N.

Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> Details of the interchanges as computed by
> CSYTRF_AA_2STAGE.

Ipiv2 : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> Details of the interchanges as computed by
> CSYTRF_AA_2STAGE.

B : Complex Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
> On exit, the solution matrix X.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
