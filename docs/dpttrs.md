 DPTTRS solves a tridiagonal system of the form
    A * X = B
 using the L*D*L**T factorization of A computed by DPTTRF.  D is a
 diagonal matrix specified in the vector D, L is a unit bidiagonal
 matrix whose subdiagonal is specified in the vector E, and X and B
 are N by NRHS matrices.

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The order of the tridiagonal matrix A.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

D : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
> L*D*L**T factorization of A.

E : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]
> The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
> L from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.  E can also be regarded
> as the superdiagonal of the unit bidiagonal factor U from the
> factorization A = U**T*D*U.

B : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side vectors B for the system of
> linear equations.
> On exit, the solution vectors, X.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
