  STRSYL3 solves the real Sylvester matrix equation:

     op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C or
     op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C,

  where op(A) = A or A**T, and  A and B are both upper quasi-
  triangular. A is M-by-M and B is N-by-N; the right hand side C and
  the solution X are M-by-N; and scale is an output scale factor, set
  <= 1 to avoid overflow in X.

  A and B must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by SHSEQR), that
  is, block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks;
  each 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
  off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.

  This is the block version of the algorithm.

## Parameters
Trana : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies the option op(A):
> = 'N': op(A) = A    (No transpose)
> = 'T': op(A) = A**T (Transpose)
> = 'C': op(A) = A**H (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

Tranb : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies the option op(B):
> = 'N': op(B) = B    (No transpose)
> = 'T': op(B) = B**T (Transpose)
> = 'C': op(B) = B**H (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

Isgn : Integer [in]
> Specifies the sign in the equation:
> = +1: solve op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C
> = -1: solve op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C

M : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A, and the number of rows in the
> matrices X and C. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix B, and the number of columns in the
> matrices X and C. N >= 0.

A : Real Array, Dimension (lda,m) [in]
> The upper quasi-triangular matrix A, in Schur canonical form.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).

B : Real Array, Dimension (ldb,n) [in]
> The upper quasi-triangular matrix B, in Schur canonical form.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).

C : Real Array, Dimension (ldc,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the M-by-N right hand side matrix C.
> On exit, C is overwritten by the solution matrix X.

Ldc : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M)

Scale : Real [out]
> The scale factor, scale, set <= 1 to avoid overflow in X.

Iwork : Integer Array, Dimension (max(1,liwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.

Liwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array IWORK. LIWORK >=  ((M + NB - 1) / NB + 1)
> + ((N + NB - 1) / NB + 1), where NB is the optimal block size.
> If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal dimension of the IWORK array,
> returns this value as the first entry of the IWORK array, and
> no error message related to LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Swork : Real Array, Dimension (max(2, Rows), [out]
> MAX(1,COLS)).
> On exit, if INFO = 0, SWORK(1) returns the optimal value ROWS
> and SWORK(2) returns the optimal COLS.

Ldswork : Integer [in]
> LDSWORK >= MAX(2,ROWS), where ROWS = ((M + NB - 1) / NB + 1)
> and NB is the optimal block size.
> If LDSWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal dimensions of the SWORK matrix,
> returns these values as the first and second entry of the SWORK
> matrix, and no error message related LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> = 1: A and B have common or very close eigenvalues; perturbed
> values were used to solve the equation (but the matrices
> A and B are unchanged).
