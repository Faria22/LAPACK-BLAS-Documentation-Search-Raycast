 ZHETRS_AA solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
 hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U**H*T*U or
 A = L*T*L**H computed by ZHETRF_AA.

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U**H*T*U;
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*T*L**H.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in]
> Details of factors computed by ZHETRF_AA.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> Details of the interchanges as computed by ZHETRF_AA.

B : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
> On exit, the solution matrix X.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If MIN(N,NRHS) = 0, LWORK >= 1, else LWORK >= 3*N-2.
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the minimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
