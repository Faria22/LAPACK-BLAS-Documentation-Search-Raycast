# DPBTRF

## Function Signature

```fortran
DPBTRF(UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, INFO)
```

## Description


 DPBTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
 positive definite band matrix A.

 The factorization has the form
    A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
    A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is CHARACTER*1 = 'U': Upper triangle of A is stored; = 'L': Lower triangle of A is stored.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

### KD (in)

KD is INTEGER The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U', or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'. KD >= 0.

### AB (in,out)

AB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N) On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows: if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j; if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd). On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the band matrix A, in the same storage format as A.

### LDAB (in)

LDAB is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array AB. LDAB >= KD+1.

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value > 0: if INFO = i, the leading principal minor of order i is not positive, and the factorization could not be completed.
