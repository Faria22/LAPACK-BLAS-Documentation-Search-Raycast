 ZTGSEN reorders the generalized Schur decomposition of a complex
 matrix pair (A, B) (in terms of an unitary equivalence trans-
 formation Q**H * (A, B) * Z), so that a selected cluster of eigenvalues
 appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the pair (A,B). The leading
 columns of Q and Z form unitary bases of the corresponding left and
 right eigenspaces (deflating subspaces). (A, B) must be in
 generalized Schur canonical form, that is, A and B are both upper
 triangular.

 ZTGSEN also computes the generalized eigenvalues

          w(j)= ALPHA(j) / BETA(j)

 of the reordered matrix pair (A, B).

 Optionally, the routine computes estimates of reciprocal condition
 numbers for eigenvalues and eigenspaces. These are Difu[(A11,B11),
 (A22,B22)] and Difl[(A11,B11), (A22,B22)], i.e. the separation(s)
 between the matrix pairs (A11, B11) and (A22,B22) that correspond to
 the selected cluster and the eigenvalues outside the cluster, resp.,
 and norms of "projections" onto left and right eigenspaces w.r.t.
 the selected cluster in the (1,1)-block.


## Parameters
Ijob : Integer [in]
> Specifies whether condition numbers are required for the
> cluster of eigenvalues (PL and PR) or the deflating subspaces
> (Difu and Difl):
> =0: Only reorder w.r.t. SELECT. No extras.
> =1: Reciprocal of norms of "projections" onto left and right
> eigenspaces w.r.t. the selected cluster (PL and PR).
> =2: Upper bounds on Difu and Difl. F-norm-based estimate
> (DIF(1:2)).
> =3: Estimate of Difu and Difl. 1-norm-based estimate
> (DIF(1:2)).
> About 5 times as expensive as IJOB = 2.
> =4: Compute PL, PR and DIF (i.e. 0, 1 and 2 above): Economic
> version to get it all.
> =5: Compute PL, PR and DIF (i.e. 0, 1 and 3 above)
