 ZLAQP2 computes a QR factorization with column pivoting of
 the block A(OFFSET+1:M,1:N).
 The block A(1:OFFSET,1:N) is accordingly pivoted, but not factorized.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A. N >= 0.

Offset : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A that must be pivoted
> but no factorized. OFFSET >= 0.

A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
> On exit, the upper triangle of block A(OFFSET+1:M,1:N) is
> the triangular factor obtained; the elements in block
> A(OFFSET+1:M,1:N) below the diagonal, together with the
> array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of
> elementary reflectors. Block A(1:OFFSET,1:N) has been
> accordingly pivoted, but no factorized.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).

Jpvt : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> On entry, if JPVT(i) .ne. 0, the i-th column of A is permuted
> to the front of A*P (a leading column); if JPVT(i) = 0,
> the i-th column of A is a free column.
> On exit, if JPVT(i) = k, then the i-th column of A*P
> was the k-th column of A.

Tau : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (min(m,n)) [out]
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors.

Vn1 : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> The vector with the partial column norms.

Vn2 : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> The vector with the exact column norms.

Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (n) [out]
