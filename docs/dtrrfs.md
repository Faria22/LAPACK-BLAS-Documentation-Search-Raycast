# DTRRFS

## Function Signature

```fortran
DTRRFS(UPLO, TRANS, DIAG, N, NRHS, A, LDA, B, LDB, X,
*                          LDX, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO)
```

## Description


 DTRRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
 solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular
 coefficient matrix.

 The solution matrix X must be computed by DTRTRS or some other
 means before entering this routine.  DTRRFS does not do iterative
 refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is CHARACTER*1 = 'U': A is upper triangular; = 'L': A is lower triangular.

### TRANS (in)

TRANS is CHARACTER*1 Specifies the form of the system of equations: = 'N': A * X = B (No transpose) = 'T': A**T * X = B (Transpose) = 'C': A**H * X = B (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

### DIAG (in)

DIAG is CHARACTER*1 = 'N': A is non-unit triangular; = 'U': A is unit triangular.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

### NRHS (in)

NRHS is INTEGER The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns of the matrices B and X. NRHS >= 0.

### A (in)

A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N) The triangular matrix A. If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not referenced. If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced. If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).

### B (in)

B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS) The right hand side matrix B.

### LDB (in)

LDB is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).

### X (in)

X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS) The solution matrix X.

### LDX (in)

LDX is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array X. LDX >= max(1,N).

### FERR (out)

FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS) The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X). If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j) is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the largest element in X(j). The estimate is as reliable as the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight overestimate of the true error.

### BERR (out)

BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS) The componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

### WORK (out)

WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)

### IWORK (out)

IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
