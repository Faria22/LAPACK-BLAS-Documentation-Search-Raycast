```fortran
subroutine slascl2	(	integer	m,
		integer	n,
		real, dimension(*)	d,
		real, dimension(ldx, *)	x,
		integer	ldx )
```

 SLASCL2 performs a diagonal scaling on a matrix:
   x <-- D * x
 where the diagonal matrix D is stored as a vector.

 Eventually to be replaced by BLAS_sge_diag_scale in the new BLAS
 standard.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of D and X. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of X. N >= 0.

D : Real Array, Length M [in]
> Diagonal matrix D, stored as a vector of length M.

X : Real Array, Dimension (ldx,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the matrix X to be scaled by D.
> On exit, the scaled matrix.

Ldx : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the matrix X. LDX >= M.
