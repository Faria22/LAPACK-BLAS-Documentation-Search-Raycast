# DTRSEN

## Function Signature

```fortran
DTRSEN(JOB, COMPQ, SELECT, N, T, LDT, Q, LDQ, WR, WI,
*                          M, S, SEP, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO)
```

## Description


 DTRSEN reorders the real Schur factorization of a real matrix
 A = Q*T*Q**T, so that a selected cluster of eigenvalues appears in
 the leading diagonal blocks of the upper quasi-triangular matrix T,
 and the leading columns of Q form an orthonormal basis of the
 corresponding right invariant subspace.

 Optionally the routine computes the reciprocal condition numbers of
 the cluster of eigenvalues and/or the invariant subspace.

 T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that is,
 block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
 off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.

## Parameters

### JOB (in)

JOB is CHARACTER*1 Specifies whether condition numbers are required for the cluster of eigenvalues (S) or the invariant subspace (SEP): = 'N': none; = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S); = 'V': for invariant subspace only (SEP); = 'B': for both eigenvalues and invariant subspace (S and SEP).

### COMPQ (in)

COMPQ is CHARACTER*1 = 'V': update the matrix Q of Schur vectors; = 'N': do not update Q.

### SELECT (in)

SELECT is LOGICAL array, dimension (N) SELECT specifies the eigenvalues in the selected cluster. To select a real eigenvalue w(j), SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. To select a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues w(j) and w(j+1), corresponding to a 2-by-2 diagonal block, either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both must be set to .TRUE.; a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues must be either both included in the cluster or both excluded.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.

### T (in,out)

T is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDT,N) On entry, the upper quasi-triangular matrix T, in Schur canonical form. On exit, T is overwritten by the reordered matrix T, again in Schur canonical form, with the selected eigenvalues in the leading diagonal blocks.

### LDT (in)

LDT is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

### Q (in,out)

Q is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ,N) On entry, if COMPQ = 'V', the matrix Q of Schur vectors. On exit, if COMPQ = 'V', Q has been postmultiplied by the orthogonal transformation matrix which reorders T; the leading M columns of Q form an orthonormal basis for the specified invariant subspace. If COMPQ = 'N', Q is not referenced.

### LDQ (in)

LDQ is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= 1; and if COMPQ = 'V', LDQ >= N.

### WR (out)

WR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

### WI (out)

WI is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N) The real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the reordered eigenvalues of T. The eigenvalues are stored in the same order as on the diagonal of T, with WR(i) = T(i,i) and, if T(i:i+1,i:i+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block, WI(i) > 0 and WI(i+1) = -WI(i). Note that if a complex eigenvalue is sufficiently ill-conditioned, then its value may differ significantly from its value before reordering.

### M (out)

M is INTEGER The dimension of the specified invariant subspace. 0 < = M <= N.

### S (out)

S is DOUBLE PRECISION If JOB = 'E' or 'B', S is a lower bound on the reciprocal condition number for the selected cluster of eigenvalues. S cannot underestimate the true reciprocal condition number by more than a factor of sqrt(N). If M = 0 or N, S = 1. If JOB = 'N' or 'V', S is not referenced.

### SEP (out)

SEP is DOUBLE PRECISION If JOB = 'V' or 'B', SEP is the estimated reciprocal condition number of the specified invariant subspace. If M = 0 or N, SEP = norm(T). If JOB = 'N' or 'E', SEP is not referenced.

### WORK (out)

WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

### LWORK (in)

LWORK is INTEGER The dimension of the array WORK. If JOB = 'N', LWORK >= max(1,N); if JOB = 'E', LWORK >= max(1,M*(N-M)); if JOB = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= max(1,2*M*(N-M)). If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

### IWORK (out)

IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK)) On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.

### LIWORK (in)

LIWORK is INTEGER The dimension of the array IWORK. If JOB = 'N' or 'E', LIWORK >= 1; if JOB = 'V' or 'B', LIWORK >= max(1,M*(N-M)). If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine only calculates the optimal size of the IWORK array, returns this value as the first entry of the IWORK array, and no error message related to LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value = 1: reordering of T failed because some eigenvalues are too close to separate (the problem is very ill-conditioned); T may have been partially reordered, and WR and WI contain the eigenvalues in the same order as in T; S and SEP (if requested) are set to zero.
