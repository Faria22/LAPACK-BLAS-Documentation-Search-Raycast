 DGTSV  solves the equation

    A*X = B,

 where A is an n by n tridiagonal matrix, by Gaussian elimination with
 partial pivoting.

 Note that the equation  A**T*X = B  may be solved by interchanging the
 order of the arguments DU and DL.

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

Dl : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in,out]
> On entry, DL must contain the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements of
> A.
> On exit, DL is overwritten by the (n-2) elements of the
> second super-diagonal of the upper triangular matrix U from
> the LU factorization of A, in DL(1), ..., DL(n-2).

D : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> On entry, D must contain the diagonal elements of A.
> On exit, D is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of U.

Du : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in,out]
> On entry, DU must contain the (n-1) super-diagonal elements
> of A.
> On exit, DU is overwritten by the (n-1) elements of the first
> super-diagonal of U.

B : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]
> On entry, the N by NRHS matrix of right hand side matrix B.
> On exit, if INFO = 0, the N by NRHS solution matrix X.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0: if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero, and the solution
> has not been computed.  The factorization has not been
> completed unless i = N.
