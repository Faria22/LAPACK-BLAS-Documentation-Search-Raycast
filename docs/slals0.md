## Description


 SLALS0 applies back the multiplying factors of either the left or the
 right singular vector matrix of a diagonal matrix appended by a row
 to the right hand side matrix B in solving the least squares problem
 using the divide-and-conquer SVD approach.

 For the left singular vector matrix, three types of orthogonal
 matrices are involved:

 (1L) Givens rotations: the number of such rotations is GIVPTR; the
      pairs of columns/rows they were applied to are stored in GIVCOL;
      and the C- and S-values of these rotations are stored in GIVNUM.

 (2L) Permutation. The (NL+1)-st row of B is to be moved to the first
      row, and for J=2:N, PERM(J)-th row of B is to be moved to the
      J-th row.

 (3L) The left singular vector matrix of the remaining matrix.

 For the right singular vector matrix, four types of orthogonal
 matrices are involved:

 (1R) The right singular vector matrix of the remaining matrix.

 (2R) If SQRE = 1, one extra Givens rotation to generate the right
      null space.

 (3R) The inverse transformation of (2L).

 (4R) The inverse transformation of (1L).
