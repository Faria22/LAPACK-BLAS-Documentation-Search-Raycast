 DLARRK computes one eigenvalue of a symmetric tridiagonal
 matrix T to suitable accuracy. This is an auxiliary code to be
 called from DSTEMR.

 To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
 largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) * underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
 accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.

 Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
 University, July 21, 1966.

## Parameters
N : Integer [in]
> The order of the tridiagonal matrix T.  N >= 0.

Iw : Integer [in]
> The index of the eigenvalues to be returned.

Gl : Double Precision [in]

Gu : Double Precision [in]
> An upper and a lower bound on the eigenvalue.

D : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in]
> The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.

E2 : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]
> The (n-1) squared off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.

Pivmin : Double Precision [in]
> The minimum pivot allowed in the Sturm sequence for T.

Reltol : Double Precision [in]
> The minimum relative width of an interval.  When an interval
> is narrower than RELTOL times the larger (in
> magnitude) endpoint, then it is considered to be
> sufficiently small, i.e., converged.  Note: this should
> always be at least radix*machine epsilon.

W : Double Precision [out]

Werr : Double Precision [out]
> The error bound on the corresponding eigenvalue approximation
> in W.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:       Eigenvalue converged
> = -1:      Eigenvalue did NOT converge
