# CGETSQRHRT

## Function Signature

```fortran
CGETSQRHRT(M, N, MB1, NB1, NB2, A, LDA, T, LDT, WORK,
*      $                       LWORK, INFO)
```

## Description


 CGETSQRHRT computes a NB2-sized column blocked QR-factorization
 of a complex M-by-N matrix A with M >= N,

    A = Q * R.

 The routine uses internally a NB1-sized column blocked and MB1-sized
 row blocked TSQR-factorization and perfors the reconstruction
 of the Householder vectors from the TSQR output. The routine also
 converts the R_tsqr factor from the TSQR-factorization output into
 the R factor that corresponds to the Householder QR-factorization,

    A = Q_tsqr * R_tsqr = Q * R.

 The output Q and R factors are stored in the same format as in CGEQRT
 (Q is in blocked compact WY-representation). See the documentation
 of CGEQRT for more details on the format.

## Parameters

### M (in)

M is INTEGER The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The number of columns of the matrix A. M >= N >= 0.

### MB1 (in)

MB1 is INTEGER The row block size to be used in the blocked TSQR. MB1 > N.

### NB1 (in)

NB1 is INTEGER The column block size to be used in the blocked TSQR. N >= NB1 >= 1.

### NB2 (in)

NB2 is INTEGER The block size to be used in the blocked QR that is output. NB2 >= 1.

### A (in,out)

A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N) On entry: an M-by-N matrix A. On exit: a) the elements on and above the diagonal of the array contain the N-by-N upper-triangular matrix R corresponding to the Householder QR; b) the elements below the diagonal represent Q by the columns of blocked V (compact WY-representation).

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).

### T (out)

T is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDT,N)) The upper triangular block reflectors stored in compact form as a sequence of upper triangular blocks.

### LDT (in)

LDT is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= NB2.

### WORK (out)

(workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

### LWORK (in)

LWORK is INTEGER The dimension of the array WORK. If MIN(M,N) = 0, LWORK >= 1, else LWORK >= MAX( 1, LWT + LW1, MAX( LWT+N*N+LW2, LWT+N*N+N ) ), where NUM_ALL_ROW_BLOCKS = CEIL((M-N)/(MB1-N)), NB1LOCAL = MIN(NB1,N). LWT = NUM_ALL_ROW_BLOCKS * N * NB1LOCAL, LW1 = NB1LOCAL * N, LW2 = NB1LOCAL * MAX( NB1LOCAL, ( N - NB1LOCAL ) ). If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed. The routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
