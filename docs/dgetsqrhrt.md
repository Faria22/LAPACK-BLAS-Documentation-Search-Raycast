 DGETSQRHRT computes a NB2-sized column blocked QR-factorization
 of a real M-by-N matrix A with M >= N,

    A = Q * R.

 The routine uses internally a NB1-sized column blocked and MB1-sized
 row blocked TSQR-factorization and perfors the reconstruction
 of the Householder vectors from the TSQR output. The routine also
 converts the R_tsqr factor from the TSQR-factorization output into
 the R factor that corresponds to the Householder QR-factorization,

    A = Q_tsqr * R_tsqr = Q * R.

 The output Q and R factors are stored in the same format as in DGEQRT
 (Q is in blocked compact WY-representation). See the documentation
 of DGEQRT for more details on the format.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A. M >= N >= 0.

Mb1 : Integer [in]
> The row block size to be used in the blocked TSQR.
> MB1 > N.

Nb1 : Integer [in]
> The column block size to be used in the blocked TSQR.
> N >= NB1 >= 1.

Nb2 : Integer [in]
> The block size to be used in the blocked QR that is
> output. NB2 >= 1.

A : Double Precision Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]
> On entry: an M-by-N matrix A.
> On exit:
> a) the elements on and above the diagonal
> of the array contain the N-by-N upper-triangular
> matrix R corresponding to the Householder QR;
> b) the elements below the diagonal represent Q by
> the columns of blocked V (compact WY-representation).

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).

T : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldt,n)) [out]
> The upper triangular block reflectors stored in compact form
> as a sequence of upper triangular blocks.

Ldt : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T.  LDT >= NB2.

Work : (workspace) Double Precision Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If MIN(M,N) = 0, LWORK >= 1, else
> LWORK >= MAX( 1, LWT + LW1, MAX( LWT+N*N+LW2, LWT+N*N+N ) ),
> where
> NUM_ALL_ROW_BLOCKS = CEIL((M-N)/(MB1-N)),
> NB1LOCAL = MIN(NB1,N).
> LWT = NUM_ALL_ROW_BLOCKS * N * NB1LOCAL,
> LW1 = NB1LOCAL * N,
> LW2 = NB1LOCAL * MAX( NB1LOCAL, ( N - NB1LOCAL ) ).
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed.
> The routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK
> array, returns this value as the first entry of the WORK
> array, and no error message related to LWORK is issued
> by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
