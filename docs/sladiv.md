```fortran
subroutine sladiv (
		real a,
		real b,
		real c,
		real d,
		real p,
		real q
)
```

 SLADIV performs complex division in  real arithmetic

                       a + i*b
            p + i*q = ---------
                       c + i*d

 The algorithm is due to Michael Baudin and Robert L. Smith
 and can be found in the paper
 "A Robust Complex Division in Scilab"
