# SLADIV

## Function Signature

```fortran
SLADIV(A, B, C, D, P, Q)
```

## Description


 SLADIV performs complex division in  real arithmetic

                       a + i*b
            p + i*q = ---------
                       c + i*d

 The algorithm is due to Michael Baudin and Robert L. Smith
 and can be found in the paper
 "A Robust Complex Division in Scilab"
