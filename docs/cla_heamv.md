# CLA_HEAMV

## Function Signature

```fortran
CLA_HEAMV(UPLO, N, ALPHA, A, LDA, X, INCX, BETA, Y,
*                             INCY)
```

## Description


 CLA_SYAMV  performs the matrix-vector operation

         y := alpha*abs(A)*abs(x) + beta*abs(y),

 where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
 n by n symmetric matrix.

 This function is primarily used in calculating error bounds.
 To protect against underflow during evaluation, components in
 the resulting vector are perturbed away from zero by (N+1)
 times the underflow threshold.  To prevent unnecessarily large
 errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,
 "symbolically" zero components are not perturbed.  A zero
 entry is considered "symbolic" if all multiplications involved
 in computing that entry have at least one zero multiplicand.

## Parameters

### UPLO (in)

UPLO is INTEGER On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as follows: UPLO = BLAS_UPPER Only the upper triangular part of A is to be referenced. UPLO = BLAS_LOWER Only the lower triangular part of A is to be referenced. Unchanged on exit.

### N (in)

N is INTEGER On entry, N specifies the number of columns of the matrix A. N must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.

### ALPHA (in)

ALPHA is REAL . On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha. Unchanged on exit.

### A (in)

A is COMPLEX array, dimension ( LDA, n ). Before entry, the leading m by n part of the array A must contain the matrix of coefficients. Unchanged on exit.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least max( 1, n ). Unchanged on exit.

### X (in)

X is COMPLEX array, dimension ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ) Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the vector x. Unchanged on exit.

### INCX (in)

INCX is INTEGER On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X. INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.

### BETA (in)

BETA is REAL . On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input. Unchanged on exit.

### Y (in,out)

Y is REAL array, dimension ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ) Before entry with BETA non-zero, the incremented array Y must contain the vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the updated vector y.

### INCY (in)

INCY is INTEGER On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y. INCY must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
