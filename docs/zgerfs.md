## Function Signature

```fortran
ZGERFS(TRANS, N, NRHS, A, LDA, AF, LDAF, IPIV, B, LDB,

```

## Description


 ZGERFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
 equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for
 the solution.

## Parameters

### TRANS (in)

TRANS is CHARACTER*1 Specifies the form of the system of equations: = 'N': A * X = B (No transpose) = 'T': A**T * X = B (Transpose) = 'C': A**H * X = B (Conjugate transpose)

### N (in)

N is INTEGER The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

### NRHS (in)

NRHS is INTEGER The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns of the matrices B and X. NRHS >= 0.

### A (in)

A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N) The original N-by-N matrix A.

### LDA (in)

LDA is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).

### AF (in)

AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N) The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U as computed by ZGETRF.

### LDAF (in)

LDAF is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array AF. LDAF >= max(1,N).

### IPIV (in)

IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N) The pivot indices from ZGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

### B (in)

B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS) The right hand side matrix B.

### LDB (in)

LDB is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).

### X (in,out)

X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS) On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZGETRS. On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

### LDX (in)

LDX is INTEGER The leading dimension of the array X. LDX >= max(1,N).

### FERR (out)

FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS) The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X). If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j) is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the largest element in X(j). The estimate is as reliable as the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight overestimate of the true error.

### BERR (out)

BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS) The componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

### WORK (out)

WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)

### RWORK (out)

RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
