## Description


 ZUNCSD computes the CS decomposition of an M-by-M partitioned
 unitary matrix X:

                                 [  I  0  0 |  0  0  0 ]
                                 [  0  C  0 |  0 -S  0 ]
     [ X11 | X12 ]   [ U1 |    ] [  0  0  0 |  0  0 -I ] [ V1 |    ]**H
 X = [-----------] = [---------] [---------------------] [---------]   .
     [ X21 | X22 ]   [    | U2 ] [  0  0  0 |  I  0  0 ] [    | V2 ]
                                 [  0  S  0 |  0  C  0 ]
                                 [  0  0  I |  0  0  0 ]

 X11 is P-by-Q. The unitary matrices U1, U2, V1, and V2 are P-by-P,
 (M-P)-by-(M-P), Q-by-Q, and (M-Q)-by-(M-Q), respectively. C and S are
 R-by-R nonnegative diagonal matrices satisfying C^2 + S^2 = I, in
 which R = MIN(P,M-P,Q,M-Q).

### WORK (out)

WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

### LWORK (in)

LWORK is INTEGER The dimension of the array WORK. If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns this value as the first entry of the work array, and no error message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

### RWORK (out)

RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension MAX(1,LRWORK) On exit, if INFO = 0, RWORK(1) returns the optimal LRWORK. If INFO > 0 on exit, RWORK(2:R) contains the values PHI(1), ..., PHI(R-1) that, together with THETA(1), ..., THETA(R), define the matrix in intermediate bidiagonal-block form remaining after nonconvergence. INFO specifies the number of nonzero PHI's.

### LRWORK (in)

LRWORK is INTEGER The dimension of the array RWORK. If LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine only calculates the optimal size of the RWORK array, returns this value as the first entry of the work array, and no error message related to LRWORK is issued by XERBLA.

### IWORK (out)

IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (M-MIN(P,M-P,Q,M-Q))

### INFO (out)

INFO is INTEGER = 0: successful exit. < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value. > 0: ZBBCSD did not converge. See the description of RWORK above for details.
