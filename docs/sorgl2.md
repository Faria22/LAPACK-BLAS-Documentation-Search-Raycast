```fortran
subroutine sorgl2 (
		integer m,
		integer n,
		integer k,
		real, dimension(lda, *) a,
		integer lda,
		real, dimension(*) tau,
		real, dimension(*) work,
		integer info
)
```

 SORGL2 generates an m by n real matrix Q with orthonormal rows,
 which is defined as the first m rows of a product of k elementary
 reflectors of order n

       Q  =  H(k) . . . H(2) H(1)

 as returned by SGELQF.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix Q. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix Q. N >= M.

K : Integer [in]
> The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines the
> matrix Q. M >= K >= 0.

A : Real Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the i-th row must contain the vector which defines
> the elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as returned
> by SGELQF in the first k rows of its array argument A.
> On exit, the m-by-n matrix Q.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The first dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).

Tau : Real Array, Dimension (k) [in]
> TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
> reflector H(i), as returned by SGELQF.

Work : Real Array, Dimension (m) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument has an illegal value
