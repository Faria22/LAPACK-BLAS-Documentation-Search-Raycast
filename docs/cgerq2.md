 CGERQ2 computes an RQ factorization of a complex m by n matrix A:
 A = R * Q.

## Parameters
M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the m by n matrix A.
> On exit, if m <= n, the upper triangle of the subarray
> A(1:m,n-m+1:n) contains the m by m upper triangular matrix R;
> if m >= n, the elements on and above the (m-n)-th subdiagonal
> contain the m by n upper trapezoidal matrix R; the remaining
> elements, with the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix
> Q as a product of elementary reflectors (see Further
> Details).

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).

Tau : Complex Array, Dimension (min(m,n)) [out]
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
> Details).

Work : Complex Array, Dimension (m) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
