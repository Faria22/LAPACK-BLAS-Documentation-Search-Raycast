subroutine chemv (
		character uplo,
		integer n,

 CHEMV  performs the matrix-vector  operation

    y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,

 where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and
 A is an n by n hermitian matrix.

## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
> triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
> follows:
> UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
> is to be referenced.
> UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A
> is to be referenced.

N : Integer [in]
> On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
> N must be at least zero.

Alpha : Complex [in]
> On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.

A : Complex Array, Dimension ( Lda, N ) [in]
> Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
> upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
> triangular part of the hermitian matrix and the strictly
> lower triangular part of A is not referenced.
> Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
> lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
> triangular part of the hermitian matrix and the strictly
> upper triangular part of A is not referenced.
> Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
> not be set and are assumed to be zero.

Lda : Integer [in]
> On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
> in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
> max( 1, n ).

X : Complex Array, Dimension At Least [in]
> ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
> Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
> element vector x.

Incx : Integer [in]
> On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
> X. INCX must not be zero.

Beta : Complex [in]
> On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is
> supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input.

Y : Complex Array, Dimension At Least [in,out]
> ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ).
> Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the n
> element vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the updated
> vector y.

Incy : Integer [in]
> On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of
> Y. INCY must not be zero.
