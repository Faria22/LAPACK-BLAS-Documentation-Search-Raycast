ZGGBAK forms the right or left eigenvectors of a complex generalized  
eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*B*x, by backward transformation on  
the computed eigenvectors of the balanced pair of matrices output by  
ZGGBAL.  
  
## Parameters  
Job : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies the type of backward transformation required:  
> = 'N':  do nothing, return immediately;  
> = 'P':  do backward transformation for permutation only;  
> = 'S':  do backward transformation for scaling only;  
> = 'B':  do backward transformations for both permutation and  
> scaling.  
> JOB must be the same as the argument JOB supplied to ZGGBAL.  
  
Side : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'R':  V contains right eigenvectors;  
> = 'L':  V contains left eigenvectors.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows of the matrix V.  N >= 0.  
  
Ilo : Integer [in]  
  
Ihi : Integer [in]  
> The integers ILO and IHI determined by ZGGBAL.  
> 1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.  
  
Lscale : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> Details of the permutations and/or scaling factors applied  
> to the left side of A and B, as returned by ZGGBAL.  
  
Rscale : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> Details of the permutations and/or scaling factors applied  
> to the right side of A and B, as returned by ZGGBAL.  
  
M : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns of the matrix V.  M >= 0.  
  
V : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldv,m) [in,out]  
> On entry, the matrix of right or left eigenvectors to be  
> transformed, as returned by ZTGEVC.  
> On exit, V is overwritten by the transformed eigenvectors.  
  
Ldv : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the matrix V. LDV >= max(1,N).  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit.  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
