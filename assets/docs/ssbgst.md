SSBGST reduces a real symmetric-definite banded generalized  
eigenproblem  A*x = lambda*B*x  to standard form  C*y = lambda*y,  
such that C has the same bandwidth as A.  
  
B must have been previously factorized as S**T*S by SPBSTF, using a  
split Cholesky factorization. A is overwritten by C = X**T*A*X, where  
X = S**(-1)*Q and Q is an orthogonal matrix chosen to preserve the  
bandwidth of A.  
  
## Parameters  
Vect : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'N':  do not form the transformation matrix X;  
> = 'V':  form X.  
  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;  
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.  
  
Ka : Integer [in]  
> The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',  
> or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KA >= 0.  
  
Kb : Integer [in]  
> The number of superdiagonals of the matrix B if UPLO = 'U',  
> or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KA >= KB >= 0.  
  
Ab : Real Array, Dimension (ldab,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band  
> matrix A, stored in the first ka+1 rows of the array.  The  
> j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB  
> as follows:  
> if UPLO = 'U', AB(ka+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ka)<=i<=j;  
> if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+ka).  
> format as A.  
  
Ldab : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KA+1.  
  
Bb : Real Array, Dimension (ldbb,n) [in]  
> The banded factor S from the split Cholesky factorization of  
> B, as returned by SPBSTF, stored in the first KB+1 rows of  
> the array.  
  
Ldbb : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array BB.  LDBB >= KB+1.  
  
X : Real Array, Dimension (ldx,n) [out]  
> If VECT = 'V', the n-by-n matrix X.  
> If VECT = 'N', the array X is not referenced.  
  
Ldx : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array X.  
> LDX >= max(1,N) if VECT = 'V'; LDX >= 1 otherwise.  
  
Work : Real Array, Dimension (2*n) [out]  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
