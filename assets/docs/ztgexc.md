ZTGEXC reorders the generalized Schur decomposition of a complex  
matrix pair (A,B), using an unitary equivalence transformation  
(A, B) := Q * (A, B) * Z**H, so that the diagonal block of (A, B) with  
row index IFST is moved to row ILST.  
  
(A, B) must be in generalized Schur canonical form, that is, A and  
B are both upper triangular.  
  
Optionally, the matrices Q and Z of generalized Schur vectors are  
updated.  
  
Q(in) * A(in) * Z(in)**H = Q(out) * A(out) * Z(out)**H  
Q(in) * B(in) * Z(in)**H = Q(out) * B(out) * Z(out)**H  
  
## Parameters  
Wantq : Logical [in]  
> .TRUE. : update the left transformation matrix Q;  
> .FALSE.: do not update Q.  
  
Wantz : Logical [in]  
> .TRUE. : update the right transformation matrix Z;  
> .FALSE.: do not update Z.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrices A and B. N >= 0.  
  
A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the upper triangular matrix A in the pair (A, B).  
> On exit, the updated matrix A.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).  
  
B : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldb,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the upper triangular matrix B in the pair (A, B).  
> On exit, the updated matrix B.  
  
Ldb : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).  
  
Q : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldq,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, if WANTQ = .TRUE., the unitary matrix Q.  
> On exit, the updated matrix Q.  
> If WANTQ = .FALSE., Q is not referenced.  
  
Ldq : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= 1;  
> If WANTQ = .TRUE., LDQ >= N.  
  
Z : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldz,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, if WANTZ = .TRUE., the unitary matrix Z.  
> On exit, the updated matrix Z.  
> If WANTZ = .FALSE., Z is not referenced.  
  
Ldz : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array Z. LDZ >= 1;  
> If WANTZ = .TRUE., LDZ >= N.  
  
Ifst : Integer [in]  
  
Ilst : Integer [in,out]  
> Specify the reordering of the diagonal blocks of (A, B).  
> The block with row index IFST is moved to row ILST, by a  
> sequence of swapping between adjacent blocks.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> =0:  Successful exit.  
> <0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.  
> =1:  The transformed matrix pair (A, B) would be too far  
> from generalized Schur form; the problem is ill-  
> conditioned. (A, B) may have been partially reordered,  
> and ILST points to the first row of the current  
> position of the block being moved.
