Using the divide and conquer method, ZLAED0 computes all eigenvalues  
of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix which is one diagonal block of  
those from reducing a dense or band Hermitian matrix and  
corresponding eigenvectors of the dense or band matrix.  
  
## Parameters  
Qsiz : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the unitary matrix used to reduce  
> the full matrix to tridiagonal form.  QSIZ >= N if ICOMPQ = 1.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.  N >= 0.  
  
D : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.  
> On exit, the eigenvalues in ascending order.  
  
E : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in,out]  
> On entry, the off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.  
> On exit, E has been destroyed.  
  
Q : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldq,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, Q must contain an QSIZ x N matrix whose columns  
> unitarily orthonormal. It is a part of the unitary matrix  
> that reduces the full dense Hermitian matrix to a  
> (reducible) symmetric tridiagonal matrix.  
  
Ldq : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array Q.  LDQ >= max(1,N).  
  
Iwork : Integer Array, [out]  
> the dimension of IWORK must be at least  
> ( lg( N ) = smallest integer k  
> such that 2^k >= N )  
  
Rwork : Double Precision Array, [out]  
> ( lg( N ) = smallest integer k  
> such that 2^k >= N )  
  
Qstore : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldqs, N) [out]  
> Used to store parts of  
> the eigenvector matrix when the updating matrix multiplies  
> take place.  
  
Ldqs : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array QSTORE.  
> LDQS >= max(1,N).  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit.  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.  
> > 0:  The algorithm failed to compute an eigenvalue while  
> working on the submatrix lying in rows and columns  
> INFO/(N+1) through mod(INFO,N+1).
