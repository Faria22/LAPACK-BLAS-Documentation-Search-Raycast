subroutine dtrttf (  
character transr,  
character uplo,  
integer n,

DTRTTF copies a triangular matrix A from standard full format (TR)  
to rectangular full packed format (TF) .  
  
## Parameters  
Transr : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'N':  ARF in Normal form is wanted;  
> = 'T':  ARF in Transpose form is wanted.  
  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;  
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.  
  
A : Double Precision Array, Dimension (lda,n). [in]  
> On entry, the triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the  
> leading N-by-N upper triangular part of the array A contains  
> the upper triangular matrix, and the strictly lower  
> triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the  
> leading N-by-N lower triangular part of the array A contains  
> the lower triangular matrix, and the strictly upper  
> triangular part of A is not referenced.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the matrix A. LDA >= max(1,N).  
  
Arf : Double Precision Array, Dimension (nt). [out]  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
