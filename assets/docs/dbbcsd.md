DBBCSD computes the CS decomposition of an orthogonal matrix in  
bidiagonal-block form,  
  
  
[ B11 | B12 0  0 ]  
[  0  |  0 -I  0 ]  
X = [----------------]  
[ B21 | B22 0  0 ]  
[  0  |  0  0  I ]  
  
[  C | -S  0  0 ]  
[ U1 |    ] [  0 |  0 -I  0 ] [ V1 |    ]**T  
= [---------] [---------------] [---------]   .  
[    | U2 ] [  S |  C  0  0 ] [    | V2 ]  
[  0 |  0  0  I ]  
  
X is M-by-M, its top-left block is P-by-Q, and Q must be no larger  
than P, M-P, or M-Q. (If Q is not the smallest index, then X must be  
transposed and/or permuted. This can be done in constant time using  
the TRANS and SIGNS options. See DORCSD for details.)  
  
The bidiagonal matrices B11, B12, B21, and B22 are represented  
implicitly by angles THETA(1:Q) and PHI(1:Q-1).  
  
The orthogonal matrices U1, U2, V1T, and V2T are input/output.  
The input matrices are pre- or post-multiplied by the appropriate  
singular vector matrices.
