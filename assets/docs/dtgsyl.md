 DTGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation:

             A * R - L * B = scale * C                 (1)
             D * R - L * E = scale * F

 where R and L are unknown m-by-n matrices, (A, D), (B, E) and
 (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size m-by-m, n-by-n and m-by-n,
 respectively, with real entries. (A, D) and (B, E) must be in
 generalized (real) Schur canonical form, i.e. A, B are upper quasi
 triangular and D, E are upper triangular.

 The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1 is an output
 scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

 In matrix notation (1) is equivalent to solve  Zx = scale b, where
 Z is defined as

            Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**T, Im) ]         (2)
                [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**T, Im) ].

 Here Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**T is the transpose of
 X. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.

 If TRANS = 'T', DTGSYL solves the transposed system Z**T*y = scale*b,
 which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

             A**T * R + D**T * L = scale * C           (3)
             R * B**T + L * E**T = scale * -F

 This case (TRANS = 'T') is used to compute an one-norm-based estimate
 of Dif[(A,D), (B,E)], the separation between the matrix pairs (A,D)
 and (B,E), using DLACON.

 If IJOB >= 1, DTGSYL computes a Frobenius norm-based estimate
 of Dif[(A,D),(B,E)]. That is, the reciprocal of a lower bound on the
 reciprocal of the smallest singular value of Z. See [1-2] for more
 information.

 This is a level 3 BLAS algorithm.
