 ZUNMLQ overwrites the general complex M-by-N matrix C with

                 SIDE = 'L'     SIDE = 'R'
 TRANS = 'N':      Q * C          C * Q
 TRANS = 'C':      Q**H * C       C * Q**H

 where Q is a complex unitary matrix defined as the product of k
 elementary reflectors

       Q = H(k)**H . . . H(2)**H H(1)**H

 as returned by ZGELQF. Q is of order M if SIDE = 'L' and of order N
 if SIDE = 'R'.

## Parameters
Side : Character*1 [in]
> = 'L': apply Q or Q**H from the Left;
> = 'R': apply Q or Q**H from the Right.

Trans : Character*1 [in]
> = 'N':  No transpose, apply Q;
> = 'C':  Conjugate transpose, apply Q**H.

M : Integer [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix C. M >= 0.

N : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix C. N >= 0.

K : Integer [in]
> The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines
> the matrix Q.
> If SIDE = 'L', M >= K >= 0;
> if SIDE = 'R', N >= K >= 0.

A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension [in]
> (LDA,M) if SIDE = 'L',
> (LDA,N) if SIDE = 'R'
> The i-th row must contain the vector which defines the
> elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as returned by
> ZGELQF in the first k rows of its array argument A.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,K).

Tau : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (k) [in]
> TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
> reflector H(i), as returned by ZGELQF.

C : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldc,n) [in,out]
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix C.
> On exit, C is overwritten by Q*C or Q**H*C or C*Q**H or C*Q.

Ldc : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M).

Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If SIDE = 'L', LWORK >= max(1,N);
> if SIDE = 'R', LWORK >= max(1,M).
> For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
