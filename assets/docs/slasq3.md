SLASQ3 checks for deflation, computes a shift (TAU) and calls dqds.  
In case of failure it changes shifts, and tries again until output  
is positive.  
  
## Parameters  
I0 : Integer [in]  
> First index.  
  
N0 : Integer [in,out]  
> Last index.  
  
Z : Real Array, Dimension ( 4*n0 ) [in,out]  
> Z holds the qd array.  
  
Pp : Integer [in,out]  
> PP=0 for ping, PP=1 for pong.  
> PP=2 indicates that flipping was applied to the Z array  
> and that the initial tests for deflation should not be  
> performed.  
  
Dmin : Real [out]  
> Minimum value of d.  
  
Sigma : Real [out]  
> Sum of shifts used in current segment.  
  
Desig : Real [in,out]  
> Lower order part of SIGMA  
  
Qmax : Real [in]  
> Maximum value of q.  
  
Nfail : Integer [in,out]  
> Increment NFAIL by 1 each time the shift was too big.  
  
Iter : Integer [in,out]  
> Increment ITER by 1 for each iteration.  
  
Ndiv : Integer [in,out]  
> Increment NDIV by 1 for each division.  
  
Ieee : Logical [in]  
> Flag for IEEE or non IEEE arithmetic (passed to SLASQ5).  
  
Ttype : Integer [in,out]  
> Shift type.  
  
Dmin1 : Real [in,out]  
  
Dmin2 : Real [in,out]  
  
Dn : Real [in,out]  
  
Dn1 : Real [in,out]  
  
Dn2 : Real [in,out]  
  
G : Real [in,out]  
  
Tau : Real [in,out]  
> These are passed as arguments in order to save their values  
> between calls to SLASQ3.
