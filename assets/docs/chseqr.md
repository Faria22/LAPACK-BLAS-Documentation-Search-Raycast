CHSEQR computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix H  
and, optionally, the matrices T and Z from the Schur decomposition  
H = Z T Z**H, where T is an upper triangular matrix (the  
Schur form), and Z is the unitary matrix of Schur vectors.  
  
Optionally Z may be postmultiplied into an input unitary  
matrix Q so that this routine can give the Schur factorization  
of a matrix A which has been reduced to the Hessenberg form H  
by the unitary matrix Q:  A = Q*H*Q**H = (QZ)*T*(QZ)**H.  
  
## Parameters  
Job : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'E':  compute eigenvalues only;  
> = 'S':  compute eigenvalues and the Schur form T.  
  
Compz : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'N':  no Schur vectors are computed;  
> = 'I':  Z is initialized to the unit matrix and the matrix Z  
> of Schur vectors of H is returned;  
> = 'V':  Z must contain an unitary matrix Q on entry, and  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.  
  
Ilo : Integer [in]  
  
Ihi : Integer [in]  
> It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows  
> and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N. ILO and IHI are normally  
> set by a previous call to CGEBAL, and then passed to ZGEHRD  
> when the matrix output by CGEBAL is reduced to Hessenberg  
> form. Otherwise ILO and IHI should be set to 1 and N  
> respectively.  If N > 0, then 1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N.  
> If N = 0, then ILO = 1 and IHI = 0.  
  
H : Complex Array, Dimension (ldh,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.  
> On exit, if INFO = 0 and JOB = 'S', H contains the upper  
> triangular matrix T from the Schur decomposition (the  
> Schur form). If INFO = 0 and JOB = 'E', the contents of  
> H are unspecified on exit.  (The output value of H when  
> INFO > 0 is given under the description of INFO below.)  
> Unlike earlier versions of CHSEQR, this subroutine may  
> explicitly H(i,j) = 0 for i > j and j = 1, 2, ... ILO-1  
> or j = IHI+1, IHI+2, ... N.  
  
Ldh : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array H. LDH >= max(1,N).  
  
W : Complex Array, Dimension (n) [out]  
> The computed eigenvalues. If JOB = 'S', the eigenvalues are  
> stored in the same order as on the diagonal of the Schur  
> form returned in H, with W(i) = H(i,i).  
  
Z : Complex Array, Dimension (ldz,n) [in,out]  
> If COMPZ = 'N', Z is not referenced.  
> If COMPZ = 'I', on entry Z need not be set and on exit,  
> if INFO = 0, Z contains the unitary matrix Z of the Schur  
> vectors of H.  If COMPZ = 'V', on entry Z must contain an  
> N-by-N matrix Q, which is assumed to be equal to the unit  
> matrix except for the submatrix Z(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI). On exit,  
> Normally Q is the unitary matrix generated by CUNGHR  
> after the call to CGEHRD which formed the Hessenberg matrix  
> H. (The output value of Z when INFO > 0 is given under  
> the description of INFO below.)  
  
Ldz : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  if COMPZ = 'I' or  
> COMPZ = 'V', then LDZ >= MAX(1,N).  Otherwise, LDZ >= 1.  
  
Work : Complex Array, Dimension (lwork) [out]  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns an estimate of  
> the optimal value for LWORK.  
  
Lwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N)  
> is sufficient and delivers very good and sometimes  
> may be required for optimal performance.  A workspace  
> query is recommended to determine the optimal workspace  
> size.  
> If LWORK = -1, then CHSEQR does a workspace query.  
> In this case, CHSEQR checks the input parameters and  
> estimates the optimal workspace size for the given  
> values of N, ILO and IHI.  The estimate is returned  
> in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is  
> issued by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal  
> value  
> > 0:  if INFO = i, CHSEQR failed to compute all of
