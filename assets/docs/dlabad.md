```fortran
subroutine dlabad (
		double precision small,
		double precision large
)
```

 DLABAD is a no-op and kept for compatibility reasons. It used
 to correct the overflow/underflow behavior of machines that
 are not IEEE-754 compliant.


## Parameters
Small : Double Precision [in,out]
> On entry, the underflow threshold as computed by DLAMCH.
> On exit, the unchanged value SMALL.

Large : Double Precision [in,out]
> On entry, the overflow threshold as computed by DLAMCH.
> On exit, the unchanged value LARGE.
