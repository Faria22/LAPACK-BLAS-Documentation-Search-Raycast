SGSVJ1 is called from SGESVJ as a pre-processor and that is its main  
purpose. It applies Jacobi rotations in the same way as SGESVJ does, but  
it targets only particular pivots and it does not check convergence  
(stopping criterion). Few tuning parameters (marked by [TP]) are  
available for the implementer.  
  
Further Details  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
SGSVJ1 applies few sweeps of Jacobi rotations in the column space of  
the input M-by-N matrix A. The pivot pairs are taken from the (1,2)  
off-diagonal block in the corresponding N-by-N Gram matrix A^T * A. The  
block-entries (tiles) of the (1,2) off-diagonal block are marked by the  
[x]'s in the following scheme:  
  
| *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|  
| *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cycling in the nblr-by-nblc [x] blocks.  
| *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cyclic pivoting inside each [x] block.  
|[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |  
|[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |  
|[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |  
  
In terms of the columns of A, the first N1 columns are rotated 'against'  
the remaining N-N1 columns, trying to increase the angle between the  
corresponding subspaces. The off-diagonal block is N1-by(N-N1) and it is  
tiled using quadratic tiles of side KBL. Here, KBL is a tuning parameter.  
The number of sweeps is given in NSWEEP and the orthogonality threshold  
is given in TOL.
