 DLALSD uses the singular value decomposition of A to solve the least
 squares problem of finding X to minimize the Euclidean norm of each
 column of A*X-B, where A is N-by-N upper bidiagonal, and X and B
 are N-by-NRHS. The solution X overwrites B.

 The singular values of A smaller than RCOND times the largest
 singular value are treated as zero in solving the least squares
 problem; in this case a minimum norm solution is returned.
 The actual singular values are returned in D in ascending order.


## Parameters
Uplo : Character*1 [in]
> = 'U': D and E define an upper bidiagonal matrix.
> = 'L': D and E define a  lower bidiagonal matrix.

Smlsiz : Integer [in]
> The maximum size of the subproblems at the bottom of the
> computation tree.

N : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the  bidiagonal matrix.  N >= 0.

Nrhs : Integer [in]
> The number of columns of B. NRHS must be at least 1.

D : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]
> On entry D contains the main diagonal of the bidiagonal
> matrix. On exit, if INFO = 0, D contains its singular values.

E : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in,out]
> Contains the super-diagonal entries of the bidiagonal matrix.
> On exit, E has been destroyed.

B : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]
> On input, B contains the right hand sides of the least
> squares problem. On output, B contains the solution X.

Ldb : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of B in the calling subprogram.
> LDB must be at least max(1,N).

Rcond : Double Precision [in]
> The singular values of A less than or equal to RCOND times
> the largest singular value are treated as zero in solving
> the least squares problem. If RCOND is negative,
> machine precision is used instead.
> For example, if diag(S)*X=B were the least squares problem,
> where diag(S) is a diagonal matrix of singular values, the
> solution would be X(i) = B(i) / S(i) if S(i) is greater than
> RCOND*max(S), and X(i) = 0 if S(i) is less than or equal to
> RCOND*max(S).

Rank : Integer [out]
> The number of singular values of A greater than RCOND times
> the largest singular value.

Work : Double Precision Array, Dimension At Least [out]
> (9*N + 2*N*SMLSIZ + 8*N*NLVL + N*NRHS + (SMLSIZ+1)**2),
> where NLVL = max(0, INT(log_2 (N/(SMLSIZ+1))) + 1).

Iwork : Integer Array, Dimension At Least [out]
> (3*N*NLVL + 11*N)

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit.
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
> > 0:  The algorithm failed to compute a singular value while
> working on the submatrix lying in rows and columns
> INFO/(N+1) through MOD(INFO,N+1).
