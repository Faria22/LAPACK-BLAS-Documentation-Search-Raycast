ZGEBD2 reduces a complex general m by n matrix A to upper or lower  
real bidiagonal form B by a unitary transformation: Q**H * A * P = B.  
  
If m >= n, B is upper bidiagonal; if m < n, B is lower bidiagonal.  
  
## Parameters  
M : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows in the matrix A.  M >= 0.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns in the matrix A.  N >= 0.

> On entry, the m by n general matrix to be reduced.  
> On exit,  
> if m >= n, the diagonal and the first superdiagonal are  
> overwritten with the upper bidiagonal matrix B; the  
> elements below the diagonal, with the array TAUQ, represent  
> the unitary matrix Q as a product of elementary  
> reflectors, and the elements above the first superdiagonal,  
> with the array TAUP, represent the unitary matrix P as
