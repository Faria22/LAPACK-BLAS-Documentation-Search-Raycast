CLAQPS computes a step of QR factorization with column pivoting  
of a complex M-by-N matrix A by using Blas-3.  It tries to factorize  
NB columns from A starting from the row OFFSET+1, and updates all  
of the matrix with Blas-3 xGEMM.  
  
In some cases, due to catastrophic cancellations, it cannot  
factorize NB columns.  Hence, the actual number of factorized  
columns is returned in KB.  
  
Block A(1:OFFSET,1:N) is accordingly pivoted, but not factorized.  
  
## Parameters  
M : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns of the matrix A. N >= 0  
  
Offset : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows of A that have been factorized in  
> previous steps.  
  
Nb : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns to factorize.  
  
Kb : Integer [out]  
> The number of columns actually factorized.  
  
A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.  
> On exit, block A(OFFSET+1:M,1:KB) is the triangular  
> factor obtained and block A(1:OFFSET,1:N) has been  
> accordingly pivoted, but no factorized.  
> The rest of the matrix, block A(OFFSET+1:M,KB+1:N) has  
> been updated.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).  
  
Jpvt : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> JPVT(I) = K <==> Column K of the full matrix A has been  
> permuted into position I in AP.  
  
Tau : Complex Array, Dimension (kb) [out]  
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors.  
  
Vn1 : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> The vector with the partial column norms.  
  
Vn2 : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> The vector with the exact column norms.  
  
Auxv : Complex Array, Dimension (nb) [in,out]  
> Auxiliary vector.  
  
F : Complex Array, Dimension (ldf,nb) [in,out]  
  
Ldf : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array F. LDF >= max(1,N).
