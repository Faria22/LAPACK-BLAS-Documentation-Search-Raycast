subroutine zgetri (  
integer n,  
complex*16, dimension(lda, *) a,

ZGETRI computes the inverse of a matrix using the LU factorization  
computed by ZGETRF.  
  
This method inverts U and then computes inv(A) by solving the system  
inv(A)*L = inv(U) for inv(A).  
  
## Parameters  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the factors L and U from the factorization  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, the inverse of the original matrix A.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).  
  
Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The pivot indices from ZGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the  
> matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).  
  
Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]  
> On exit, if INFO=0, then WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.  
  
Lwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N).  
> the optimal blocksize returned by ILAENV.  
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine  
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns  
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error  
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value  
> > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero; the matrix is  
> singular and its inverse could not be computed.
