subroutine csyr2k (  
character uplo,  
character trans,

CSYR2K  performs one of the symmetric rank 2k operations  
  
C := alpha*A*B**T + alpha*B*A**T + beta*C,  
  
or  
  
C := alpha*A**T*B + alpha*B**T*A + beta*C,  
  
where  alpha and beta  are scalars,  C is an  n by n symmetric matrix  
and  A and B  are  n by k  matrices  in the  first  case  and  k by n  
matrices in the second case.  
  
## Parameters  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower

> follows:  
> UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the  upper triangular part of  C  
> is to be referenced.  
> UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the  lower triangular part of  C  
> is to be referenced.  
  
Trans : Character*1 [in]  
> On entry,  TRANS  specifies the operation to be performed as  
> follows:  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> On entry,  N specifies the order of the matrix C.  N must be

> matrices  A and B.  K must be at least zero.  
  
Alpha : Complex [in]  
> On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.  
  
A : Complex Array, Dimension ( Lda, Ka ), Where Ka is [in]

> part of the array  A  must contain the matrix  A,  otherwise  
> the leading  k by n  part of the array  A  must contain  the  
> matrix A.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared  
> in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   When  TRANS = 'N' or 'n'  
> then  LDA must be at least  max( 1, n ), otherwise  LDA must  
> be at least  max( 1, k ).  
  
B : Complex Array, Dimension ( Ldb, Kb ), Where Kb is [in]  
> k  when  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  and is  n  otherwise.  
> Before entry with  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  the  leading  n by k  
> part of the array  B  must contain the matrix  B,  otherwise  
> the leading  k by n  part of the array  B  must contain  the  
> matrix B.  
  
Ldb : Integer [in]  
> On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared  
> in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   When  TRANS = 'N' or 'n'  
> then  LDB must be at least  max( 1, n ), otherwise  LDB must  
> be at least  max( 1, k ).  
  
Beta : Complex [in]  
> On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta.  
  
C : Complex Array, Dimension ( Ldc, N ) [in,out]  
> Before entry  with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the leading  n by n  
> upper triangular part of the array C must contain the upper  
> triangular part  of the  symmetric matrix  and the strictly  
> lower triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the  
> upper triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the  
> upper triangular part of the updated matrix.  
> Before entry  with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',  the leading  n by n  
> lower triangular part of the array C must contain the lower  
> triangular part  of the  symmetric matrix  and the strictly  
> upper triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the  
> lower triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the  
> lower triangular part of the updated matrix.  
  
Ldc : Integer [in]  
> On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
