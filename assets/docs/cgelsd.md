CGELSD computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least  
squares problem:  
minimize 2-norm(| b - A*x |)  
using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. A is an M-by-N  
matrix which may be rank-deficient.  
  
Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be  
handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the  
M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution  
matrix X.  
  
The problem is solved in three steps:  
(1) Reduce the coefficient matrix A to bidiagonal form with  
Householder transformations, reducing the original problem  
into a "bidiagonal least squares problem" (BLS)  
(2) Solve the BLS using a divide and conquer approach.  
(3) Apply back all the Householder transformations to solve  
the original least squares problem.  
  
The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those  
singular values which are less than RCOND times the largest singular  
value.  
  
  
## Parameters  
M : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns of the matrix A. N >= 0.  
  
Nrhs : Integer [in]  
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns  
> of the matrices B and X. NRHS >= 0.  
  
A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.  
> On exit, A has been destroyed.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).  
  
B : Complex Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]  
> On entry, the M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.  
> On exit, B is overwritten by the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.  
> If m >= n and RANK = n, the residual sum-of-squares for  
> the solution in the i-th column is given by the sum of  
> squares of the modulus of elements n+1:m in that column.  
  
Ldb : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,M,N).  
  
S : Real Array, Dimension (min(m,n)) [out]  
> The singular values of A in decreasing order.  
> The condition number of A in the 2-norm = S(1)/S(min(m,n)).  
  
Rcond : Real [in]  
> RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A.  
> If RCOND < 0, machine precision is used instead.  
  
Rank : Integer [out]  
> The effective rank of A, i.e., the number of singular values  
  
Work : Complex Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.  
  
Lwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK must be at least 1.  
> The exact minimum amount of workspace needed depends on M,  
> N and NRHS. As long as LWORK is at least  
> if M is greater than or equal to N or  
> if M is less than N, the code will execute correctly.  
> For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.  
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine  
> only calculates the optimal size of the array WORK and the  
> minimum sizes of the arrays RWORK and IWORK, and returns  
> these values as the first entries of the WORK, RWORK and  
> IWORK arrays, and no error message related to LWORK is issued  
> by XERBLA.  
  
Rwork : Real Array, Dimension (max(1,lrwork)) [out]  
> LRWORK >=  
> if M is greater than or equal to N or  
> if M is less than N, the code will execute correctly.  
> SMLSIZ is returned by ILAENV and is equal to the maximum  
> size of the subproblems at the bottom of the computation  
> tree (usually about 25), and  
> NLVL = MAX( 0, INT( LOG_2( MIN( M,N )/(SMLSIZ+1) ) ) + 1 )  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, RWORK(1) returns the minimum LRWORK.  
  
Iwork : Integer Array, Dimension (max(1,liwork)) [out]  
> where MINMN = MIN( M,N ).  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the minimum LIWORK.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0: successful exit  
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.  
> > 0:  the algorithm for computing the SVD failed to converge;  
> if INFO = i, i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate  
> bidiagonal form did not converge to zero.
