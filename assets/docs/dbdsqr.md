DBDSQR computes the singular values and, optionally, the right and/or  
left singular vectors from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of  
a real N-by-N (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix B using the implicit  
zero-shift QR algorithm.  The SVD of B has the form  
  
B = Q * S * P**T  
  
where S is the diagonal matrix of singular values, Q is an orthogonal  
matrix of left singular vectors, and P is an orthogonal matrix of  
right singular vectors.  If left singular vectors are requested, this  
subroutine actually returns U*Q instead of Q, and, if right singular  
vectors are requested, this subroutine returns P**T*VT instead of  
P**T, for given real input matrices U and VT.  When U and VT are the  
orthogonal matrices that reduce a general matrix A to bidiagonal  
form:  A = U*B*VT, as computed by DGEBRD, then  
  
A = (U*Q) * S * (P**T*VT)  
  
is the SVD of A.  Optionally, the subroutine may also compute Q**T*C  
for a given real input matrix C.
