ZUNG2R generates an m by n complex matrix Q with orthonormal columns,  
which is defined as the first n columns of a product of k elementary  
reflectors of order m  
  
Q  =  H(1) H(2) . . . H(k)  
  
as returned by ZGEQRF.  
  
## Parameters  
M : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows of the matrix Q. M >= 0.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns of the matrix Q. M >= N >= 0.  
  
K : Integer [in]  
> The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines the  
> matrix Q. N >= K >= 0.  
  
A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the i-th column must contain the vector which  
> defines the elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as  
> returned by ZGEQRF in the first k columns of its array  
> argument A.  
> On exit, the m by n matrix Q.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The first dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).  
  
Tau : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (k) [in]  
> TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary  
> reflector H(i), as returned by ZGEQRF.  
  
Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (n) [out]  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0: successful exit  
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument has an illegal value
