CLAQR5 called by CLAQR0 performs a  
single small-bulge multi-shift QR sweep.  
  
## Parameters  
Wantt : Logical [in]  
> WANTT = .true. if the triangular Schur factor  
> is being computed.  WANTT is set to .false. otherwise.  
  
Wantz : Logical [in]  
> WANTZ = .true. if the unitary Schur factor is being  
> computed.  WANTZ is set to .false. otherwise.  
  
Kacc22 : Integer With Value 0, 1, or 2. [in]  
> Specifies the computation mode of far-from-diagonal  
> orthogonal updates.  
> = 0: CLAQR5 does not accumulate reflections and does not  
> use matrix-matrix multiply to update far-from-diagonal  
> matrix entries.  
> = 1: CLAQR5 accumulates reflections and uses matrix-matrix  
> multiply to update the far-from-diagonal matrix entries.  
> = 2: Same as KACC22 = 1. This option used to enable exploiting  
> the 2-by-2 structure during matrix multiplications, but  
> this is no longer supported.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> N is the order of the Hessenberg matrix H upon which this  
> subroutine operates.  
  
Ktop : Integer [in]  
  
Kbot : Integer [in]  
> These are the first and last rows and columns of an  
> isolated diagonal block upon which the QR sweep is to be  
> applied. It is assumed without a check that  
> either KTOP = 1  or   H(KTOP,KTOP-1) = 0  
> and  
> either KBOT = N  or   H(KBOT+1,KBOT) = 0.  
  
Nshfts : Integer [in]  
> NSHFTS gives the number of simultaneous shifts.  NSHFTS  
> must be positive and even.  
  
S : Complex Array, Dimension (nshfts) [in,out]  
> S contains the shifts of origin that define the multi-  
> shift QR sweep.  On output S may be reordered.  
  
H : Complex Array, Dimension (ldh,n) [in,out]  
> On input H contains a Hessenberg matrix.  On output a  
> to the isolated diagonal block in rows and columns KTOP  
> through KBOT.  
  
Ldh : Integer [in]  
> LDH is the leading dimension of H just as declared in the  
> calling procedure.  LDH >= MAX(1,N).  
  
Iloz : Integer [in]  
  
Ihiz : Integer [in]  
> Specify the rows of Z to which transformations must be  
> applied if WANTZ is .TRUE.. 1 <= ILOZ <= IHIZ <= N  
  
Z : Complex Array, Dimension (ldz,ihiz) [in,out]  
> If WANTZ = .TRUE., then the QR Sweep unitary  
> similarity transformation is accumulated into  
> Z(ILOZ:IHIZ,ILOZ:IHIZ) from the right.  
> If WANTZ = .FALSE., then Z is unreferenced.  
  
Ldz : Integer [in]  
> LDA is the leading dimension of Z just as declared in  
> the calling procedure. LDZ >= N.  
  
V : Complex Array, Dimension (ldv,nshfts/2) [out]  
  
Ldv : Integer [in]  
> LDV is the leading dimension of V as declared in the  
> calling procedure.  LDV >= 3.  
  
U : Complex Array, Dimension (ldu,2*nshfts) [out]  
  
Ldu : Integer [in]  
> LDU is the leading dimension of U just as declared in the  
  
Nv : Integer [in]  
> NV is the number of rows in WV agailable for workspace.  
> NV >= 1.  
  
Wv : Complex Array, Dimension (ldwv,2*nshfts) [out]  
  
Ldwv : Integer [in]  
> LDWV is the leading dimension of WV as declared in the  
> in the calling subroutine.  LDWV >= NV.  
  
Nh : Integer [in]  
> NH is the number of columns in array WH available for  
> workspace. NH >= 1.  
  
Wh : Complex Array, Dimension (ldwh,nh) [out]  
  
Ldwh : Integer [in]  
> Leading dimension of WH just as declared in the
