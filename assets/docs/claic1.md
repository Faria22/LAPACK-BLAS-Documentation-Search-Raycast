integer job,  
integer j,  
complex, dimension(j) x,

)  
```  
  
CLAIC1 applies one step of incremental condition estimation in  
its simplest version:  
  
Let x, twonorm(x) = 1, be an approximate singular vector of an j-by-j  
lower triangular matrix L, such that  
twonorm(L*x) = sest  
Then CLAIC1 computes sestpr, s, c such that  
the vector  
[ s*x ]  
xhat = [  c  ]  
is an approximate singular vector of  
[ L      0  ]  
Lhat = [ w**H gamma ]  
in the sense that  
twonorm(Lhat*xhat) = sestpr.  
  
Depending on JOB, an estimate for the largest or smallest singular  
value is computed.  
  
Note that [s c]**H and sestpr**2 is an eigenpair of the system  
  
diag(sest*sest, 0) + [alpha  gamma] * [ conjg(alpha) ]  
[ conjg(gamma) ]  
  
where  alpha =  x**H*w.
