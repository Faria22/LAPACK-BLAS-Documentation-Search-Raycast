CLARRV computes the eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix  
T = L D L**T given L, D and APPROXIMATIONS to the eigenvalues of L D L**T.  
The input eigenvalues should have been computed by SLARRE.  
  
## Parameters  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.  
  
Vl : Real [in]  
> Lower bound of the interval that contains the desired  
> eigenvalues. VL < VU. Needed to compute gaps on the left or right  
> end of the extremal eigenvalues in the desired RANGE.  
  
Vu : Real [in]  
> Upper bound of the interval that contains the desired  
> eigenvalues. VL < VU. Needed to compute gaps on the left or right  
> end of the extremal eigenvalues in the desired RANGE.  
  
D : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the N diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D.  
> On exit, D may be overwritten.  
  
L : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the (N-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit  
> bidiagonal matrix L are in elements 1 to N-1 of L  
> (if the matrix is not split.) At the end of each block  
> is stored the corresponding shift as given by SLARRE.  
> On exit, L is overwritten.  
  
Pivmin : Real [in]  
> The minimum pivot allowed in the Sturm sequence.  
  
Isplit : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The splitting points, at which T breaks up into blocks.  
> The first block consists of rows/columns 1 to  
> ISPLIT( 1 ), the second of rows/columns ISPLIT( 1 )+1  
> through ISPLIT( 2 ), etc.  
  
M : Integer [in]  
> The total number of input eigenvalues.  0 <= M <= N.  
  
Dol : Integer [in]  
  
Dou : Integer [in]  
> If the user wants to compute only selected eigenvectors from all  
> the eigenvalues supplied, he can specify an index range DOL:DOU.  
> Or else the setting DOL=1, DOU=M should be applied.  
> Note that DOL and DOU refer to the order in which the eigenvalues  
> are stored in W.  
> If the user wants to compute only selected eigenpairs, then  
> the columns DOL-1 to DOU+1 of the eigenvector space Z contain the  
> computed eigenvectors. All other columns of Z are set to zero.  
  
Minrgp : Real [in]  
  
Rtol1 : Real [in]  
  
Rtol2 : Real [in]  
> Parameters for bisection.  
> An interval [LEFT,RIGHT] has converged if  
  
W : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> The first M elements of W contain the APPROXIMATE eigenvalues for  
> which eigenvectors are to be computed.  The eigenvalues  
> should be grouped by split-off block and ordered from  
> smallest to largest within the block ( The output array  
> W from SLARRE is expected here ). Furthermore, they are with  
> respect to the shift of the corresponding root representation  
> for their block. On exit, W holds the eigenvalues of the  
> UNshifted matrix.  
  
Werr : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> The first M elements contain the semiwidth of the uncertainty  
> interval of the corresponding eigenvalue in W  
  
Wgap : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> The separation from the right neighbor eigenvalue in W.  
  
Iblock : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The indices of the blocks (submatrices) associated with the  
> corresponding eigenvalues in W; IBLOCK(i)=1 if eigenvalue  
> W(i) belongs to the first block from the top, =2 if W(i)  
> belongs to the second block, etc.  
  
Indexw : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The indices of the eigenvalues within each block (submatrix);  
> for example, INDEXW(i)= 10 and IBLOCK(i)=2 imply that the  
> i-th eigenvalue W(i) is the 10-th eigenvalue in the second block.  
  
Gers : Real Array, Dimension (2*n) [in]  
> The N Gerschgorin intervals (the i-th Gerschgorin interval  
> be computed from the original UNshifted matrix.  
  
Z : Complex Array, Dimension (ldz, Max(1,m) ) [out]  
> If INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z contain the  
> orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix T  
> corresponding to the input eigenvalues, with the i-th  
> column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).  
> Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are  
> supplied in the array Z.  
  
Ldz : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if  
> JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).  
  
Isuppz : Integer Array, Dimension ( 2*max(1,m) ) [out]  
> The support of the eigenvectors in Z, i.e., the indices  
> indicating the nonzero elements in Z. The I-th eigenvector
