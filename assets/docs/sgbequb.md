SGBEQUB computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an  
M-by-N matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row  
scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make  
the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with  
elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have an absolute value of at most  
the radix.  
  
R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be a power of the radix between  
SMLNUM = smallest safe number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use  
of these scaling factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition  
number of A but works well in practice.  
  
This routine differs from SGEEQU by restricting the scaling factors  
to a power of the radix.  Barring over- and underflow, scaling by  
these factors introduces no additional rounding errors.  However, the  
scaled entries' magnitudes are no longer approximately 1 but lie  
between sqrt(radix) and 1/sqrt(radix).  
  
## Parameters  
M : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
Kl : Integer [in]  
> The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.  
  
Ku : Integer [in]  
> The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.  
  
Ab : Real Array, Dimension (ldab,n) [in]  
> On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.  
> The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the  
> array AB as follows:  
> AB(KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+kl)  
  
Ldab : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDAB >= max(1,M).  
  
R : Real Array, Dimension (m) [out]  
> If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, R contains the row scale factors  
> for A.  
  
C : Real Array, Dimension (n) [out]  
> If INFO = 0,  C contains the column scale factors for A.  
  
Rowcnd : Real [out]  
> If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, ROWCND contains the ratio of the  
> smallest R(i) to the largest R(i).  If ROWCND >= 0.1 and  
> AMAX is neither too large nor too small, it is not worth  
> scaling by R.  
  
Colcnd : Real [out]  
> If INFO = 0, COLCND contains the ratio of the smallest  
> C(i) to the largest C(i).  If COLCND >= 0.1, it is not  
> worth scaling by C.  
  
Amax : Real [out]  
> Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very  
> close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix  
> should be scaled.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value  
> > 0:  if INFO = i,  and i is  
> <= M:  the i-th row of A is exactly zero  
> >  M:  the (i-M)-th column of A is exactly zero
