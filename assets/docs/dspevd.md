DSPEVD computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors  
of a real symmetric matrix A in packed storage. If eigenvectors are  
desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.  
  
  
## Parameters  
Jobz : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;  
> = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  
  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;  
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
Ap : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n*(n+1)/2) [in,out]  
> On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix  
> A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A  
> is stored in the array AP as follows:  
> On exit, AP is overwritten by values generated during the  
> reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the diagonal  
> and first superdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T overwrite  
> the corresponding elements of A, and if UPLO = 'L', the  
> diagonal and first subdiagonal of T overwrite the  
> corresponding elements of A.  
  
W : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [out]  
> If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.  
  
Z : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldz, N) [out]  
> If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthonormal  
> eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z  
> holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).  
> If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.  
  
Ldz : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if  
> JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).  
  
Work : Double Precision Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the required LWORK.  
  
Lwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array WORK.  
> If N <= 1,               LWORK must be at least 1.  
> If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least  
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine  
> only calculates the required sizes of the WORK and IWORK  
> arrays, returns these values as the first entries of the WORK  
> and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to LWORK or  
> LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.  
  
Iwork : Integer Array, Dimension (max(1,liwork)) [out]  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the required LIWORK.  
  
Liwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array IWORK.  
> If JOBZ  = 'N' or N <= 1, LIWORK must be at least 1.  
> If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the  
> routine only calculates the required sizes of the WORK and  
> IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of  
> the WORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to  
> LWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.  
> > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i  
> off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal  
> form did not converge to zero.
