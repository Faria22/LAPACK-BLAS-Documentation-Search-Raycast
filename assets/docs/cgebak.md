CGEBAK forms the right or left eigenvectors of a complex general  
matrix by backward transformation on the computed eigenvectors of the  
balanced matrix output by CGEBAL.  
  
## Parameters  
Job : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies the type of backward transformation required:  
> = 'N': do nothing, return immediately;  
> = 'P': do backward transformation for permutation only;  
> = 'S': do backward transformation for scaling only;  
> = 'B': do backward transformations for both permutation and  
> scaling.  
> JOB must be the same as the argument JOB supplied to CGEBAL.  
  
Side : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'R':  V contains right eigenvectors;  
> = 'L':  V contains left eigenvectors.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows of the matrix V.  N >= 0.  
  
Ilo : Integer [in]  
  
Ihi : Integer [in]  
> The integers ILO and IHI determined by CGEBAL.  
> 1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.  
  
Scale : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> Details of the permutation and scaling factors, as returned  
> by CGEBAL.  
  
M : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns of the matrix V.  M >= 0.  
  
V : Complex Array, Dimension (ldv,m) [in,out]  
> On entry, the matrix of right or left eigenvectors to be  
> transformed, as returned by CHSEIN or CTREVC.  
> On exit, V is overwritten by the transformed eigenvectors.  
  
Ldv : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array V. LDV >= max(1,N).  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
