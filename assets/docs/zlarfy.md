```fortran  
subroutine zlarfy (  
character uplo,  
integer n,  
complex*16, dimension(*) v,  
integer incv,  
complex*16 tau,  
complex*16, dimension(ldc, *) c,  
integer ldc,

)  
```  
  
ZLARFY applies an elementary reflector, or Householder matrix, H,  
to an n x n Hermitian matrix C, from both the left and the right.  
  
H is represented in the form  
  
H = I - tau * v * v'  
  
where  tau  is a scalar and  v  is a vector.  
  
If  tau  is  zero, then  H  is taken to be the unit matrix.  
  
## Parameters  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the  
> Hermitian matrix C is stored.  
> = 'U':  Upper triangle  
> = 'L':  Lower triangle  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The number of rows and columns of the matrix C.  N >= 0.  
  
V : Complex*16 Array, Dimension [in]  
> The vector v as described above.  
  
Incv : Integer [in]  
> The increment between successive elements of v.  INCV must  
> not be zero.  
  
Tau : Complex*16 [in]  
> The value tau as described above.  
  
C : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (ldc, N) [in,out]  
> On entry, the matrix C.  
  
Ldc : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array C.  LDC >= max( 1, N ).  
  
Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (n) [out]
