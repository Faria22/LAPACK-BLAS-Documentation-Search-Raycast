SLALN2 solves a system of the form  (ca A - w D ) X = s B  
or (ca A**T - w D) X = s B   with possible scaling ("s") and  
perturbation of A.  (A**T means A-transpose.)  
  
A is an NA x NA real matrix, ca is a real scalar, D is an NA x NA  
real diagonal matrix, w is a real or complex value, and X and B are  
NA x 1 matrices -- real if w is real, complex if w is complex.  NA  
may be 1 or 2.  
  
If w is complex, X and B are represented as NA x 2 matrices,  
the first column of each being the real part and the second  
being the imaginary part.  
  
"s" is a scaling factor (<= 1), computed by SLALN2, which is  
so chosen that X can be computed without overflow.  X is further  
scaled if necessary to assure that norm(ca A - w D)*norm(X) is less  
than overflow.  
  
If both singular values of (ca A - w D) are less than SMIN,  
SMIN*identity will be used instead of (ca A - w D).  If only one  
singular value is less than SMIN, one element of (ca A - w D) will be  
perturbed enough to make the smallest singular value roughly SMIN.  
If both singular values are at least SMIN, (ca A - w D) will not be  
perturbed.  In any case, the perturbation will be at most some small  
multiple of max( SMIN, ulp*norm(ca A - w D) ).  The singular values  
are computed by infinity-norm approximations, and thus will only be  
correct to a factor of 2 or so.  
  
Note: all input quantities are assumed to be smaller than overflow  
by a reasonable factor.  (See BIGNUM.)  
  
## Parameters  
Ltrans : Logical [in]  
> =.TRUE.:  A-transpose will be used.  
> =.FALSE.: A will be used (not transposed.)  
  
Na : Integer [in]  
> The size of the matrix A.  It may (only) be 1 or 2.  
  
Nw : Integer [in]  
> 1 if "w" is real, 2 if "w" is complex.  It may only be 1  
> or 2.  
  
Smin : Real [in]  
> The desired lower bound on the singular values of A.  This  
> should be a safe distance away from underflow or overflow,  
> say, between (underflow/machine precision) and  (machine  
  
Ca : Real [in]  
> The coefficient c, which A is multiplied by.  
  
A : Real Array, Dimension (lda,na) [in]  
> The NA x NA matrix A.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]

D1 : Real [in]  
> The 1,1 element in the diagonal matrix D.  
  
D2 : Real [in]  
> The 2,2 element in the diagonal matrix D.  Not used if NA=1.  
  
B : Real Array, Dimension (ldb,nw) [in]  
> The NA x NW matrix B (right-hand side).  If NW=2 ("w" is

Ldb : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of B.  It must be at least NA.  
  
Wr : Real [in]  
> The real part of the scalar "w".

X : Real Array, Dimension (ldx,nw) [out]  
> The NA x NW matrix X (unknowns), as computed by SLALN2.  
> If NW=2 ("w" is complex), on exit, column 1 will contain  
> the real part of X and column 2 will contain the imaginary  
> part.  
  
Ldx : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of X.  It must be at least NA.  
  
Scale : Real [out]  
> The scale factor that B must be multiplied by to insure

> perturbations of A.)  It will be at most 1.  
  
Xnorm : Real [out]

Info : Integer [out]  
> An error flag.  It will be set to zero if no error occurs,  
> a negative number if an argument is in error, or a positive  
> number if  ca A - w D  had to be perturbed.  
> The possible values are:

> = 1: (ca A - w D) had to be perturbed to make its smallest  
> (or only) singular value greater than SMIN.
