CSYCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the  
1-norm) of a complex symmetric matrix A using the factorization  
A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by CSYTRF.  
  
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the  
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).  
  
## Parameters  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored  
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in]  
> The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to  
> obtain the factor U or L as computed by CSYTRF.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).  
  
Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D  
> as determined by CSYTRF.  
  
Anorm : Real [in]  
> The 1-norm of the original matrix A.  
  
Rcond : Real [out]  
> The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,  
> estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.  
  
Work : Complex Array, Dimension (2*n) [out]  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
