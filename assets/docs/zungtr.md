subroutine zungtr (  
character uplo,

ZUNGTR generates a complex unitary matrix Q which is defined as the  
product of n-1 elementary reflectors of order N, as returned by  
ZHETRD:  
  
if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),  
  
if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).  
  
## Parameters  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> = 'U': Upper triangle of A contains elementary reflectors  
> from ZHETRD;  
> = 'L': Lower triangle of A contains elementary reflectors  
> from ZHETRD.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix Q. N >= 0.  
  
A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the vectors which define the elementary reflectors,  
> as returned by ZHETRD.  
> On exit, the N-by-N unitary matrix Q.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= N.  
  
Tau : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]  
> TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary  
> reflector H(i), as returned by ZHETRD.  
  
Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.  
  
Lwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= N-1.  
> the optimal blocksize.  
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine  
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns  
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error  
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
