SGBTRS solves a system of linear equations  
A * X = B  or  A**T * X = B  
with a general band matrix A using the LU factorization computed  
by SGBTRF.  
  
## Parameters  
Trans : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies the form of the system of equations.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
Kl : Integer [in]  
> The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.  
  
Ku : Integer [in]  
> The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.  
  
Nrhs : Integer [in]  
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns  
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.  
  
Ab : Real Array, Dimension (ldab,n) [in]  
> Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as  
> computed by SGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band  
> matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and  
> the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in  
  
Ldab : Integer [in]  
  
Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was  
> interchanged with row IPIV(i).  
  
B : Real Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]  
> On entry, the right hand side matrix B.  
> On exit, the solution matrix X.  
  
Ldb : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
