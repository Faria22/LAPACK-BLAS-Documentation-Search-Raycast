DGEQP3RK performs two tasks simultaneously:  
  
Task 1: The routine computes a truncated (rank K) or full rank  
Householder QR factorization with column pivoting of a real  
M-by-N matrix A using Level 3 BLAS. K is the number of columns  
that were factorized, i.e. factorization rank of the  
factor R, K <= min(M,N).  
  
A * P(K) = Q(K) * R(K)  =  
  
= Q(K) * ( R11(K) R12(K) ) = Q(K) * (   R(K)_approx    )  
( 0      R22(K) )          ( 0  R(K)_residual ),  
  
where:  
  
P(K)            is an N-by-N permutation matrix;  
Q(K)            is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix;  
R(K)_approx   = ( R11(K), R12(K) ) is a rank K approximation of the  
full rank factor R with K-by-K upper-triangular  
R11(K) and K-by-N rectangular R12(K). The diagonal  
entries of R11(K) appear in non-increasing order  
of absolute value, and absolute values of all of  
them exceed the maximum column 2-norm of R22(K)  
up to roundoff error.  
R(K)_residual = R22(K) is the residual of a rank K approximation  
of the full rank factor R. It is a  
an (M-K)-by-(N-K) rectangular matrix;  
0               is a an (M-K)-by-K zero matrix.  
  
Task 2: At the same time, the routine overwrites a real M-by-NRHS  
matrix B with  Q(K)**T * B  using Level 3 BLAS.  
  
=====================================================================  
  
The matrices A and B are stored on input in the array A as  
the left and right blocks A(1:M,1:N) and A(1:M, N+1:N+NRHS)  
respectively.  
  
N     NRHS  
array_A   =   M  [ mat_A, mat_B ]  
  
The truncation criteria (i.e. when to stop the factorization)  
can be any of the following:  
  
1) The input parameter KMAX, the maximum number of columns  
KMAX to factorize, i.e. the factorization rank is limited  
to KMAX. If KMAX >= min(M,N), the criterion is not used.  
  
2) The input parameter ABSTOL, the absolute tolerance for  
the maximum column 2-norm of the residual matrix R22(K). This  
means that the factorization stops if this norm is less or  
equal to ABSTOL. If ABSTOL < 0.0, the criterion is not used.  
  
3) The input parameter RELTOL, the tolerance for the maximum  
column 2-norm matrix of the residual matrix R22(K) divided  
by the maximum column 2-norm of the original matrix A, which  
is equal to abs(R(1,1)). This means that the factorization stops  
when the ratio of the maximum column 2-norm of R22(K) to  
the maximum column 2-norm of A is less than or equal to RELTOL.  
If RELTOL < 0.0, the criterion is not used.  
  
4) In case both stopping criteria ABSTOL or RELTOL are not used,  
and when the residual matrix R22(K) is a zero matrix in some  
factorization step K. ( This stopping criterion is implicit. )  
  
The algorithm stops when any of these conditions is first  
satisfied, otherwise the whole matrix A is factorized.  
  
To factorize the whole matrix A, use the values  
KMAX >= min(M,N), ABSTOL < 0.0 and RELTOL < 0.0.  
  
The routine returns:  
a) Q(K), R(K)_approx = ( R11(K), R12(K) ),  
R(K)_residual = R22(K), P(K), i.e. the resulting matrices  
of the factorization; P(K) is represented by JPIV,  
( if K = min(M,N), R(K)_approx is the full factor R,  
and there is no residual matrix R(K)_residual);  
b) K, the number of columns that were factorized,  
i.e. factorization rank;  
c) MAXC2NRMK, the maximum column 2-norm of the residual  
matrix R(K)_residual = R22(K),  
( if K = min(M,N), MAXC2NRMK = 0.0 );  
d) RELMAXC2NRMK equals MAXC2NRMK divided by MAXC2NRM, the maximum  
column 2-norm of the original matrix A, which is equal  
to abs(R(1,1)), ( if K = min(M,N), RELMAXC2NRMK = 0.0 );  
e) Q(K)**T * B, the matrix B with the orthogonal  
transformation Q(K)**T applied on the left.  
  
The N-by-N permutation matrix P(K) is stored in a compact form in  
the integer array JPIV. For 1 <= j <= N, column j  
of the matrix A was interchanged with column JPIV(j).  
  
The M-by-M orthogonal matrix Q is represented as a product  
of elementary Householder reflectors  
  
Q(K) = H(1) *  H(2) * . . . * H(K),  
  
where K is the number of columns that were factorized.  
  
Each H(j) has the form  
  
H(j) = I - tau * v * v**T,  
  
where 1 <= j <= K and  
I    is an M-by-M identity matrix,  
tau  is a real scalar,  
v    is a real vector with v(1:j-1) = 0 and v(j) = 1.  
  
v(j+1:M) is stored on exit in A(j+1:M,j) and tau in TAU(j).
