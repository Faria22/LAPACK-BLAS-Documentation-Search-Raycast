CLALSA is an intermediate step in solving the least squares problem  
by computing the SVD of the coefficient matrix in compact form (The  
singular vectors are computed as products of simple orthogonal  
matrices.).  
  
If ICOMPQ = 0, CLALSA applies the inverse of the left singular vector  
matrix of an upper bidiagonal matrix to the right hand side; and if  
ICOMPQ = 1, CLALSA applies the right singular vector matrix to the  
right hand side. The singular vector matrices were generated in  
compact form by CLALSA.
