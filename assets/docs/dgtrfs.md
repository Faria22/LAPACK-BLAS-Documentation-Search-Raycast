DGTRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear  
equations when the coefficient matrix is tridiagonal, and provides  
error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.  
  
## Parameters  
Trans : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies the form of the system of equations:  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
Nrhs : Integer [in]  
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns  
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.  
  
Dl : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]  
> The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of A.  
  
D : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The diagonal elements of A.  
  
Du : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]  
> The (n-1) superdiagonal elements of A.  
  
Dlf : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]  
> The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the  
> LU factorization of A as computed by DGTTRF.  
  
Df : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from  
> the LU factorization of A.  
  
Duf : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-1) [in]  
> The (n-1) elements of the first superdiagonal of U.  
  
Du2 : Double Precision Array, Dimension (n-2) [in]  
> The (n-2) elements of the second superdiagonal of U.  
  
Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was  
> interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either  
> i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not  
> required.  
  
B : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in]  
> The right hand side matrix B.  
  
Ldb : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).  
  
X : Double Precision Array, Dimension (ldx,nrhs) [in,out]  
> On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DGTTRS.  
> On exit, the improved solution matrix X.  
  
Ldx : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).  
  
Ferr : Double Precision Array, Dimension (nrhs) [out]  
> The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector  
> X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).  
> If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)  
> is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest  
> element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the  
> largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as  
> the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight  
> overestimate of the true error.  
  
Berr : Double Precision Array, Dimension (nrhs) [out]  
> The componentwise relative backward error of each solution  
> vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in  
> any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).  
  
Work : Double Precision Array, Dimension (3*n) [out]  
  
Iwork : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [out]  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
