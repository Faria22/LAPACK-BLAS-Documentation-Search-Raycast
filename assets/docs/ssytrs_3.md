SSYTRS_3 solves a system of linear equations A * X = B with a real  
symmetric matrix A using the factorization computed  
by SSYTRF_RK or SSYTRF_BK:  
  
A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),  
  
where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,  
U**T (or L**T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation  
matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block  
diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.  
  
This algorithm is using Level 3 BLAS.  
  
## Parameters  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are  
> stored as an upper or lower triangular matrix:  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
Nrhs : Integer [in]  
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns  
> of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.  
  
A : Real Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in]  
> Diagonal of the block diagonal matrix D and factors U or L  
> as computed by SSYTRF_RK and SSYTRF_BK:  
> a) ONLY diagonal elements of the symmetric block diagonal  
> matrix D on the diagonal of A, i.e. D(k,k) = A(k,k);  
> (superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) elements of D  
> should be provided on entry in array E), and  
> b) If UPLO = 'U': factor U in the superdiagonal part of A.  
> If UPLO = 'L': factor L in the subdiagonal part of A.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).  
  
E : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> On entry, contains the superdiagonal (or subdiagonal)  
> elements of the symmetric block diagonal matrix D  
> with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 diagonal blocks, where  
> If UPLO = 'U': E(i) = D(i-1,i),i=2:N, E(1) not referenced;  
> If UPLO = 'L': E(i) = D(i+1,i),i=1:N-1, E(N) not referenced.  
> NOTE: For 1-by-1 diagonal block D(k), where  
> 1 <= k <= N, the element E(k) is not referenced in both  
> UPLO = 'U' or UPLO = 'L' cases.  
  
Ipiv : Integer Array, Dimension (n) [in]  
> Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D  
> as determined by SSYTRF_RK or SSYTRF_BK.  
  
B : Real Array, Dimension (ldb,nrhs) [in,out]  
> On entry, the right hand side matrix B.  
> On exit, the solution matrix X.  
  
Ldb : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
