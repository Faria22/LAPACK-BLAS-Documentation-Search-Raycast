SLATRS3 solves one of the triangular systems  
  
A * X = B * diag(scale)  or  A**T * X = B * diag(scale)  
  
with scaling to prevent overflow.  Here A is an upper or lower  
triangular matrix, A**T denotes the transpose of A. X and B are  
n by nrhs matrices and scale is an nrhs element vector of scaling  
factors. A scaling factor scale(j) is usually less than or equal  
to 1, chosen such that X(:,j) is less than the overflow threshold.  
If the matrix A is singular (A(j,j) = 0 for some j), then  
a non-trivial solution to A*X = 0 is returned. If the system is  
so badly scaled that the solution cannot be represented as  
(1/scale(k))*X(:,k), then x(:,k) = 0 and scale(k) is returned.  
  
This is a BLAS-3 version of LATRS for solving several right  
hand sides simultaneously.  
  
  
## Parameters  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies whether the matrix A is upper or lower triangular.  
> = 'U':  Upper triangular  
> = 'L':  Lower triangular  
  
Trans : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies the operation applied to A.  
  
Diag : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies whether or not the matrix A is unit triangular.  
> = 'N':  Non-unit triangular  
> = 'U':  Unit triangular  
  
Normin : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies whether CNORM has been set or not.  
> = 'Y':  CNORM contains the column norms on entry  
> = 'N':  CNORM is not set on entry.  On exit, the norms will  
> be computed and stored in CNORM.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  
  
Nrhs : Integer [in]  
> The number of columns of X.  NRHS >= 0.  
  
A : Real Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in]  
> The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading n by n  
> upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper  
> triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of  
> A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading n by n lower  
> triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular  
> matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not  
> referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are  
> also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max (1,N).  
  
X : Real Array, Dimension (ldx,nrhs) [in,out]  
> On entry, the right hand side B of the triangular system.  
> On exit, X is overwritten by the solution matrix X.  
  
Ldx : Integer [in]  
> The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max (1,N).  
  
Scale : Real Array, Dimension (nrhs) [out]  
> The scaling factor s(k) is for the triangular system  
> If SCALE = 0, the matrix A is singular or badly scaled.  
> If A(j,j) = 0 is encountered, a non-trivial vector x(:,k)  
> is returned. If the system so badly scaled that solution  
> is returned.  
  
Cnorm : Real Array, Dimension (n) [in,out]  
> If NORMIN = 'Y', CNORM is an input argument and CNORM(j)  
> contains the norm of the off-diagonal part of the j-th column  
> of A.  If TRANS = 'N', CNORM(j) must be greater than or equal  
> to the infinity-norm, and if TRANS = 'T' or 'C', CNORM(j)  
> must be greater than or equal to the 1-norm.  
> If NORMIN = 'N', CNORM is an output argument and CNORM(j)  
> returns the 1-norm of the offdiagonal part of the j-th column  
> of A.  
  
Work : Real Array, Dimension (max(1,lwork)) [out]  
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.  
  
Lwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array WORK.  
> If MIN(N,NRHS) = 0, LWORK >= 1, else  
> NBA = (N + NB - 1)/NB and NB is the optimal block size.  
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine  
> only calculates the optimal dimensions of the WORK array, returns  
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error  
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.  
  
Info : Integer [out]  
> = 0:  successful exit  
> < 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
