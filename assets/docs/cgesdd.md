CGESDD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a complex  
M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and/or right singular  
vectors, by using divide-and-conquer method. The SVD is written  
  
A = U * SIGMA * conjugate-transpose(V)  
  
where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its  
min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M unitary matrix, and  
V is an N-by-N unitary matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA  
are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and  
are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of  
U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.  
  
Note that the routine returns VT = V**H, not V.  
  
  
## Parameters  
Jobz : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix U:  
> returned in the arrays U and VT;  
> = 'S':  the first min(M,N) columns of U and the first

> = 'O':  If M >= N, the first N columns of U are overwritten  
> the array VT;  
> otherwise, all columns of U are returned in the

M : Integer [in]

A : Complex Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in,out]  
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.  
> On exit,  
> if JOBZ = 'O',  A is overwritten with the first N columns

> if JOBZ .ne. 'O', the contents of A are destroyed.  
  
Lda : Integer [in]

Ldu : Integer [in]

Lwork : Integer [in]  
> The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= 1.  
> If LWORK = -1, a workspace query is assumed.  The optimal

> Let mx = max(M,N) and mn = min(M,N).  
> These are not tight minimums in all cases; see comments inside code.
