 ZGECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a general
 complex matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm, using
 the LU factorization computed by ZGETRF.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as
    RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).

## Parameters
Norm : Character*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
> infinity-norm condition number is required:
> = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
> = 'I':         Infinity-norm.

N : Integer [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (lda,n) [in]
> The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
> as computed by ZGETRF.

Lda : Integer [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

Anorm : Double Precision [in]
> If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
> If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.

Rcond : Double Precision [out]
> The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
> computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).

Work : Complex*16 Array, Dimension (2*n) [out]

Rwork : Double Precision Array, Dimension (2*n) [out]

Info : Integer [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
> NaNs are illegal values for ANORM, and they propagate to
> the output parameter RCOND.
> Infinity is illegal for ANORM, and it propagates to the output
> parameter RCOND as 0.
> = 1:  if RCOND = NaN, or
> RCOND = Inf, or
> the computed norm of the inverse of A is 0.
> In the latter, RCOND = 0 is returned.
