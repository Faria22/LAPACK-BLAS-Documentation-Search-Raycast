 ZGGSVP3 computes unitary matrices U, V and Q such that

                    N-K-L  K    L
  U**H*A*Q =     K ( 0    A12  A13 )  if M-K-L >= 0;
                 L ( 0     0   A23 )
             M-K-L ( 0     0    0  )

                  N-K-L  K    L
         =     K ( 0    A12  A13 )  if M-K-L < 0;
             M-K ( 0     0   A23 )

                  N-K-L  K    L
  V**H*B*Q =   L ( 0     0   B13 )
             P-L ( 0     0    0  )

 where the K-by-K matrix A12 and L-by-L matrix B13 are nonsingular
 upper triangular; A23 is L-by-L upper triangular if M-K-L >= 0,
 otherwise A23 is (M-K)-by-L upper trapezoidal.  K+L = the effective
 numerical rank of the (M+P)-by-N matrix (A**H,B**H)**H.

 This decomposition is the preprocessing step for computing the
 Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD), see subroutine
 ZGGSVD3.

> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

Lwork : Integer [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= 1.
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
