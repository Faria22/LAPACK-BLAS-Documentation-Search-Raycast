subroutine chpmv (  
character uplo,  
integer n,  
complex alpha,

CHPMV  performs the matrix-vector operation  
  
y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,  
  
where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and  
A is an n by n hermitian matrix, supplied in packed form.  
  
## Parameters  
Uplo : Character*1 [in]  
> On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower  
> triangular part of the matrix A is supplied in the packed  
> array AP as follows:  
> UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   The upper triangular part of A is  
> supplied in AP.  
> UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   The lower triangular part of A is  
> supplied in AP.  
  
N : Integer [in]  
> On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.  
> N must be at least zero.  
  
Alpha : Complex [in]  
> On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.  
  
Ap : Complex Array, Dimension At Least [in]  
> Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must  
> contain the upper triangular part of the hermitian matrix  
> packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 )  
> contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 )  
> and a( 2, 2 ) respectively, and so on.  
> Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must  
> contain the lower triangular part of the hermitian matrix  
> packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 )  
> contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 )  
> and a( 3, 1 ) respectively, and so on.  
> Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need  
> not be set and are assumed to be zero.  
  
X : Complex Array, Dimension At Least [in]  
> Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n  
> element vector x.  
  
Incx : Integer [in]  
> On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of  
> X. INCX must not be zero.  
  
Beta : Complex [in]  
> On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is  
> supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input.  
  
Y : Complex Array, Dimension At Least [in,out]  
> Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the n  
> element vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the updated  
> vector y.  
  
Incy : Integer [in]  
> On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of  
> Y. INCY must not be zero.
