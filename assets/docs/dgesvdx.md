DGESVDX computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real  
M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and/or right singular  
vectors. The SVD is written  
  
A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)  
  
where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its  
min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and  
V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA  
are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and  
are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of  
U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.  
  
DGESVDX uses an eigenvalue problem for obtaining the SVD, which  
allows for the computation of a subset of singular values and  
vectors. See DBDSVDX for details.  
  
Note that the routine returns V**T, not V.  
  
## Parameters  
Jobu : Character*1 [in]  
> Specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix U:  
> = 'V':  the first min(m,n) columns of U (the left singular  
> vectors) or as specified by RANGE are returned in  
> the array U;  
> = 'N':  no columns of U (no left singular vectors) are  
> computed.
