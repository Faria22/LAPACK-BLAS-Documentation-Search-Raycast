# LAPACK/BLAS Documentation Search Changelog

## [1.1.0] - {PR_MERGE_DATE}

### Added
- Scripted Netlib synchronization (`scripts/generate_inventory.py`) to backfill markdown docs and rebuild metadata.
- Regenerated every routine markdown file directly from the official Netlib documentation (e.g., `dgemm`, `ddot`, `cdotc`) with consistent signature formatting.
- Expanded inventory to 2,178 LAPACK/BLAS routines with official URLs, categories, and summaries sourced from Netlib.

### Changed
- Removed legacy markdown files for routines not present in the official Netlib topics index to keep the dataset aligned.
- Removed the unused helper script (`scripts/update_markdown_description_blocks.py`) now that Netlib regeneration handles formatting.
